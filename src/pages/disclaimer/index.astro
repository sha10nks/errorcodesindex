    <h2>Informational Purpose Only</h2>
    <p>
      ErrorCodesIndex.com is a reference library. It exists to help you locate error codes, see common interpretations,
      and understand typical next steps. It is not official documentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Error codes can vary by vendor, device model, firmware/software version, configuration, region, and date.
      A code that means one thing in one context can mean something else in another.
    </p>

    <h2>No Professional Advice</h2>
    <p>
      Content on this site does not constitute professional advice. That includes (but is not limited to) legal,
      medical, tax, financial, cybersecurity, or safety advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are responsible for choosing qualified professionals when a situation requires it.
    </p>

    <h2>Accuracy Limitations</h2>
    <p>
      We aim to keep pages consistent and well structured, but we do not guarantee accuracy, completeness, or
      currency.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Some pages describe typical causes, not definitive causes.</li>
      <li>Some pages reference vendor terms that change over time.</li>
      <li>Some codes are reused or overloaded across product lines.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Even when a code identifier is correct, the resolution path can differ based on environment. Network conditions,
      service outages, user permissions, and account state often change the meaning of “the same” code. Treat pages as
      a starting point, not a conclusion.
    </p>

    <h2>Vendor Documentation Supremacy</h2>
    <p>
      If there is any conflict between this site and official documentation from the vendor, manufacturer, or service
      operator, the official documentation controls.
    </p>
    <p>
      When troubleshooting, always cross-check:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>official manuals and service bulletins</li>
      <li>release notes and firmware/patch documentation</li>
      <li>support advisories and incident communications</li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <h2>User Responsibility</h2>
    <p>
      You are responsible for your actions and decisions. If you apply any steps suggested by a page, do so under your
      own policies and safety controls.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use change management and backups where appropriate.</li>
      <li>Follow your organization’s security procedures.</li>
      <li>Do not run commands or apply fixes you do not understand.</li>
      <li>For appliances and physical systems, follow safety instructions and qualified service guidance.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Some categories on this site reference systems with real-world impact (for example: healthcare claims, banking
      transactions, or home appliances). If a failure affects safety, compliance, or money movement, stop and consult
      the appropriate official channel.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>No Endorsement</h2>
    <p>
      Links, product mentions, and brand names are included for identification. They should not be interpreted as an
      endorsement or as an official relationship.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>No Guarantee Clause</h2>
    <p>
      We do not guarantee outcomes. Troubleshooting results depend on context. A fix that works for one environment
      may fail or cause harm in another.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>External Links</h2>
    <p>
      Links to third-party sites are provided for convenience. We do not control those sites and are not responsible
      for their content or policies.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Reporting Errors</h2>
    <p>
      If you report a correction, include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>the exact URL</li>
      <li>the error code shown on the system</li>
      <li>vendor/model/version context if available</li>
      <li>the specific sentence or section that is incorrect</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This helps us verify changes and avoid breaking stable content for other contexts.
    </p>

    <hr />

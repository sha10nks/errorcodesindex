  <h2>Purpose</h2>
  <p>
    ErrorCodesIndex.com is a plain-English reference library for system error codes across multiple industries. The site
    is intentionally documentation-style: neutral wording, predictable structure, and stable internal links.
  </p>

  <h2>Editorial policy</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Error-code page bodies are imported verbatim from a locked source document.</li>
    <li>We do not rewrite, paraphrase, or invent error-code explanations.</li>
    <li>Non-code pages may include organizational and legal information required to operate the site.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Site architecture</h2>
  <p>
    The site is built as fully static HTML with crawlable navigation. Canonical URLs, breadcrumb markup, and a
    build-generated sitemap are used to support predictable indexing.
  </p>
</SectionLayout>

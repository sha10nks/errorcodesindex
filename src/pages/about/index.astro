    <h2>Mission</h2>
    <p>
      Error codes are a compressed language used by software, devices, and service platforms. They are often surfaced
      without context, and official references are frequently scattered across product pages, PDFs, and fragmented
      support threads. The mission of ErrorCodesIndex.com is straightforward: provide a structured index of error codes
      and publish documentation-style pages that explain what a code typically means and what usually happens next.
    </p>
    <p>
      We focus on clarity and consistency. The goal is not to replace vendor documentation, support desks, or
      professional service. The goal is to make the first five minutes of troubleshooting less ambiguous.
    </p>

    <h2>Documentation Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      This site is written as reference documentation, not as a marketing page and not as a conversational assistant.
      That influences the structure of every page:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Stable structure</strong>: pages follow repeatable sections (meaning, common causes, typical steps).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Low ambiguity</strong>: we prefer concrete statements with scope, and we avoid promises.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Scan-first formatting</strong>: headings, short paragraphs, and bullet lists where they help.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Vendor-first truth</strong>: official manuals and advisories override any summary here.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When a code is known to vary by model, region, firmware, or provider, we try to call that out explicitly.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Source Import Pipeline</h2>
    <p>
      ErrorCodesIndex.com is built around a source-import publishing workflow. Content for many pages is authored and
      maintained in a locked source document, then compiled into the site at build time. This approach helps with:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Consistency</strong>: pages share a predictable structure and vocabulary.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Reviewability</strong>: changes can be audited at the source level before publication.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Deterministic builds</strong>: the published site is generated from a fixed input set.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The site also adds navigation, indexing metadata, and internal cross-links to make content discoverable. Those
      additions are editorial and structural; they are not meant to change the underlying meaning of vendor terms.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Neutrality and Independence</h2>
    <p>
      This project is independent. We do not claim affiliation with any vendor referenced on the site. Brand names and
      trademarks are used for identification and navigation only.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neutrality matters for a reference library. Where there are multiple plausible interpretations of a code, we aim
      to present common meanings, point to official references when available, and avoid framing that pressures a user
      into a single course of action.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Structured Architecture and Crawlability</h2>
    <p>
      The site is designed to be crawlable and linkable. Pages use stable, readable URLs and a consistent hierarchy.
      That hierarchy is part of the product: it makes it possible to browse by industry, model family, and specific
      code.
    </p>
    <p>
      We publish static pages and avoid requiring JavaScript to read core content. Search is implemented as an
      enhancement for speed and convenience, while the underlying navigation remains accessible.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Long-Term Archiving Strategy</h2>
    <p>
      Error codes have a long tail: codes remain searchable years after a product is discontinued or a platform is
      replaced. A major design goal is keeping URLs stable so references do not rot. When pages must move, the intent
      is to preserve canonical paths whenever possible and keep internal linking coherent.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a code becomes obsolete or superseded, we prefer to keep the page and annotate it rather than delete it.
      Removal is reserved for cases that require takedown or where content is clearly harmful.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Corrections and Takedown Requests</h2>
    <p>
      If you believe a page is inaccurate, incomplete, or should be corrected, send the URL and the specific issue via
      <a href="/contact/">/contact/</a>. If you represent a rights holder and believe content should be removed, include
      enough detail to identify the material and explain the request.
    </p>

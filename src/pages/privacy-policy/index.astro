    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      ErrorCodesIndex.com is a static reference website. The site does not provide user accounts, subscriptions, or
      logins. We do not process payments. Most visitors can read pages without providing any information directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like any website delivered through modern hosting infrastructure, limited technical data is processed to serve
      pages, protect the site, and measure reliability. This policy describes what data is involved, why it exists, and
      what control you have.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <h3>1) Request and security logs</h3>
    <p>
      Our hosting, CDN, and security providers may record request metadata when you load a page. Typical fields include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>IP address (often stored in provider logs)</li>
      <li>User agent and basic device/browser information</li>
      <li>Timestamp, request URL/path, and HTTP status</li>
      <li>Referrer header (if your browser sends one)</li>
      <li>Performance and security signals (rate limiting, bot detection, error traces)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This information is used for operational security and debugging. It is not used to create a profile of you across
      unrelated websites.
    </p>

    <h3>2) Contact form submissions</h3>
    <p>
      If you submit the contact form, we receive the fields you provide (typically name, email address, and message).
      The content of your message may include additional information you choose to share.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do not send sensitive personal data (for example: government IDs, financial account numbers, medical records,
      passwords, or authentication tokens). This site is not designed for confidential communications.
    </p>

    <h3>3) Cookies and similar identifiers</h3>
    <p>
      We may use cookies or similar technologies for limited purposes such as traffic measurement, fraud prevention,
      and (if enabled) advertising delivery and frequency control. The specific cookies depend on which services are
      enabled in the current deployment.
    </p>

    <h2>How Data Is Used</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Deliver pages and assets reliably via hosting/CDN infrastructure.</li>
      <li>Protect the site from abuse (automated scraping, attacks, excessive traffic).</li>
      <li>Diagnose errors, broken routes, and performance regressions.</li>
      <li>Respond to contact submissions and track follow-ups when needed.</li>
      <li>Measure aggregate usage (for example: which categories are visited most).</li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <h2>Log Data &amp; Analytics</h2>
    <p>
      If analytics is enabled, it is used to understand aggregate behavior (page views, referral sources, and
      high-level geography derived from IP). Analytics is not intended to identify individual visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some providers may process IP addresses and user agents for deduplication, security, and abuse prevention. Where
      possible, we prefer settings that minimize retention and limit unnecessary identifiers.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Cookies &amp; Tracking</h2>
    <p>
      Cookies can be used for session integrity, rate limiting, and (if enabled) advertising measurement. Depending on
      your region, you may see consent prompts provided by a consent framework.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>You can block or delete cookies in your browser settings.</li>
      <li>Blocking cookies may reduce functionality (for example: consent preferences or anti-abuse measures).</li>
      <li>Some browsers offer “Do Not Track” signals; handling varies by provider.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      Retention is driven by operational need and provider defaults.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Contact submissions</strong>: retained only as long as needed to address the request and maintain basic
        administrative records.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Infrastructure logs</strong>: retained according to hosting/CDN/security provider policies.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <h2>Third-Party Links</h2>
    <p>
      Pages may link to third-party sites (for example: vendor documentation or official references). We do not control
      those sites. Their privacy practices apply when you leave ErrorCodesIndex.com.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Security Practices</h2>
    <p>
      We use common web security controls provided by modern hosting infrastructure (TLS, CDN caching, request
      filtering, and rate limiting). No website can guarantee absolute security; you should treat public web forms as
      non-confidential.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The site is a general reference resource and is not directed to children. We do not knowingly collect personal
      information from children through the site.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Jurisdiction</h2>
    <p>
      ErrorCodesIndex.com is operated as an informational website. Privacy requirements differ by region. If you are
      subject to a specific legal framework (for example: GDPR/UK GDPR, CCPA/CPRA), you can contact us to request
      clarification about data handling and retention.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this policy to reflect operational changes (for example: enabling/disabling analytics providers,
      changes to hosting, or updates to the contact process). The effective date at the top indicates the current
      version.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <p>

      your request concerns a specific page, include the URL in your message.

Healthcare error codes are short identifiers used on claims, remittance advice, and eligibility responses to explain what happened and what needs attention next. They often point to coverage rules, documentation gaps, authorization requirements, or mismatches between the billed service and the payer’s processing logic.

This directory is built for billing teams, providers, and patients who need fast, neutral explanations without guesswork. Pages are organized by common prefixes (CO-, PR-, OA-, PI-) and the most frequently encountered denial and adjustment reasons. Each entry focuses on what the code typically means in practice and which checks usually resolve it.

- Browse codes by prefix to quickly narrow down the “type” of denial or adjustment
- Review common denial scenarios and the data elements that trigger them
- Jump to recently indexed codes to see what’s been added most recently
- Compare similar codes that look alike but require different fixes
- Use the guide and FAQ for repeatable troubleshooting steps

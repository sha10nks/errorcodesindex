## How to Read Healthcare Error Codes

Healthcare error codes follow standardized formats established by the healthcare industry. Understanding these patterns helps identify the root cause of claim denials and processing failures.

### 1. Identify the Code Type
Healthcare codes typically begin with prefixes that indicate the type of issue:
- **CO-**: Contractual obligations between provider and payer
- **PR-**: Patient responsibility amounts
- **OA-**: Other adjustments not covered by other categories
- **PI-**: Payer-initiated adjustments
- **CARC**: Claim Adjustment Reason Codes

### 2. Understand the Context
Each code includes contextual information about:
- The specific service or procedure involved
- The date of service
- The provider who submitted the claim
- The insurance company processing the claim

### 3. Cross-Reference with Documentation
Always verify error codes against official documentation from:
- Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)
- Insurance company provider manuals
- HIPAA transaction and code set standards

### 4. Take Action Based on Code Type
Different code types require different responses:
- **Denial codes**: May require claim resubmission or appeal
- **Adjustment codes**: Often indicate payment modifications

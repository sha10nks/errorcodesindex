Appliance error codes are diagnostic signals displayed by modern machines when sensors, motors, valves, heaters, and control boards detect abnormal conditions. The same code can mean slightly different things across brands, which is why appliance type, model series, and service context matter when you troubleshoot.

This directory is organized as a crawlable hierarchy: appliance type → brand → series/model → code pages. It’s designed for homeowners and technicians who want a clear starting point before parts swapping or service calls. Each entry focuses on likely causes, safe checks you can do first, and what typically requires professional diagnosis.

- Start with your appliance type, then narrow by brand and model/series
- Use the category grid to find the right directory path quickly
- Review recently indexed pages to surface new models and code families
- Follow the guide for a practical “what to check first” workflow
- Use the FAQ to decide when a reset is reasonable vs. when to stop and call service

### What should I do if my card is declined?

Contact your card issuer immediately using the number on the back of your card. They can explain why the transaction was declined and help resolve any issues. Common reasons include insufficient funds, expired card, or suspected fraud.

### How can I resolve a "Do Not Honor" (Code 05) error?

This is a generic decline from your card issuer. Contact your bank to verify your account status, check for any holds or restrictions, and confirm the transaction is legitimate. The bank may need to authorize the specific merchant or transaction type.

### What does "Invalid Transaction" (Code 12) mean?

This error indicates the transaction type is not supported by your card or the merchant's payment processor. Try a different payment method or contact your card issuer to verify your card supports the transaction type.

### Why am I getting "Insufficient Funds" (Code 51) when I have money in my account?

This may be due to pending transactions, holds on your account, daily transaction limits, or the merchant requesting authorization for a higher amount than the purchase price. Contact your bank to verify your available balance and any restrictions.

### What is an ACH return code and how do I fix it?

ACH return codes indicate problems with electronic transfers between banks. Common codes include insufficient funds, account closed, or invalid account numbers. Contact the originating bank to resolve the specific issue indicated by the return code.

### How can I prevent payment processing errors?

Keep your card information updated, monitor your account balance, notify your bank of travel plans, use secure payment methods, and ensure your billing address matches your card statement address.

### What should merchants do about payment processing errors?

Train staff to recognize common error codes, have backup payment methods available, maintain current payment processor settings, monitor transaction patterns for unusual activity, and contact your payment processor for technical issues.

### How long do payment authorizations last?

Most card authorizations last 7-30 days depending on the card network and merchant type. Some authorizations may expire sooner, requiring the merchant to re-authorize the transaction before capturing funds.

Banking error codes are response signals returned by card networks, issuers, processors, and transfer systems when a payment can’t be completed as requested. A single code can indicate anything from “do not honor” and insufficient funds to invalid data, network timeouts, fraud controls, or account restrictions.

This directory is for merchants, support teams, and consumers who need a quick interpretation that matches the real-world scenario. Codes are grouped by common families (05, 12, 14, 51, 54, 91, and ACH return patterns), and each entry focuses on what to check first, what can be retried safely, and when you need issuer or processor involvement.

## How to Read IRS Notices and Tax Codes

IRS notices and tax error codes follow standardized formats established by the Internal Revenue Service. Understanding these patterns helps identify the root cause of tax filing issues and processing delays.

### 1. Identify the Notice Type
IRS notices typically begin with prefixes that indicate the type of communication:
- **CP-**: Computer Paragraph notices for routine matters
- **LT-**: Letter notices for more serious issues
- **TC-**: Transaction codes on transcripts
- **Form numbers**: Specific tax forms like 1040, W-2, 1099

### 2. Understand the Context
Each notice includes contextual information about:
- The specific tax year involved
- The type of tax return or form
- The amount of tax, interest, or penalties
- The deadline for response or payment

### 3. Cross-Reference with IRS Documentation
Always verify notice codes against official IRS documentation:
- IRS Publication 594 (The IRS Collection Process)
- IRS Publication 5 (Your Appeal Rights)
- Taxpayer Bill of Rights
- Current IRS forms and instructions

### 4. Take Action Based on Notice Type
Different notice types require different responses:
- **Information notices**: May require no action
- **Adjustment notices**: May require payment or documentation
- **Audit notices**: May require supporting documentation
- **Collection notices**: May require payment arrangements

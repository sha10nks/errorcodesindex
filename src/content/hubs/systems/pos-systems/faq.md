### Are POS errors the same as card decline codes?
Not always. Some POS errors are internal workflow issues, while others represent processor or network outcomes.

### Should I keep retrying failed charges?
Avoid repeated retries if you’re unsure whether a transaction succeeded. Confirm the final status in the POS and processor record.

### Do POS errors usually mean hardware is broken?
Often not. Many are configuration or connectivity issues, especially during updates or network changes.

### What’s the safest first check?
Confirm connectivity and the status of required services (internet, POS backend, payment processor).

### Do you cover vendor-specific POS platforms?
Only when the error identifiers are widely documented and reliably mapped.

### Can a POS issue be caused by time/date settings?
Yes. Incorrect device time can affect TLS/SSL connections and authentication flows.

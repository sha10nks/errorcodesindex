## Reading POS system errors

When a POS issue appears, first identify the layer:

- **POS app** (login, menu sync, order routing)
- **Payment processing** (authorization/settlement status)
- **Peripheral devices** (printers, scanners, terminals)
- **Network** (WAN/DNS/DHCP issues)

Safe steps generally include confirming internet connectivity, verifying device pairing, checking service status pages, and retrying after a controlled restart of the affected component.

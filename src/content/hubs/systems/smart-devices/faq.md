### Do smart device codes mean the device is defective?
Often no. Many codes indicate setup or connectivity issues.

### Should I delete and re-add the device?
Only after confirming your account and network are stable. Re-adding can reset configuration.

### Can Wi‑Fi band selection matter?
Yes. Many devices require 2.4GHz and won’t join 5GHz-only networks.

### Are cloud outages a common cause?
Yes. If a vendor service is down, devices may fail to authenticate or update.

### Do firmware updates fail often?
They can, especially on weak Wi‑Fi. Retrying on a stable network is usually the safest first step.

### What’s the safest isolation step?
Test whether other devices on the same network can reach the internet reliably.

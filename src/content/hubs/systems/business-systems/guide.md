## How to approach business system errors

Treat business-system codes as context-dependent:

- Confirm the **product** and **version** showing the error.
- Note whether the failure is **local** (single machine) or **shared** (multi-user, server, or network).
- Capture the **exact code and message** as displayed.

Most safe first steps include verifying account permissions, confirming file paths and access, checking service status, and retrying after syncing or restarting the relevant components.

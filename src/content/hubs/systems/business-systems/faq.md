### Why are many business codes non-numeric?
Vendors often use letter-prefixed codes to group issues by subsystem (networking, licensing, payroll, company file access).

### Can I fix these without vendor support?
Sometimes, but many business products intentionally limit error detail. When the platform hides specifics, official support is often required.

### Do you store credentials or customer data?
No. Pages are static references and do not collect user account data.

### Are these the same as banking response codes?
No. Banking response codes belong to payment networks and issuers. Business-system codes are product-specific and can vary by vendor.

### What should I provide to support?
The exact code string, timestamp, product version, and the action you attempted are typically the most useful.

### Why does the same code show different messages?
Some products reuse codes across multiple flows. Context (the screen and workflow) matters.

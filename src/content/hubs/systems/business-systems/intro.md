Business systems often present errors as application-specific codes (sometimes with letter prefixes) alongside a short message. These identifiers usually map to a workflow stage such as sign-in, licensing, file access, multi-user connectivity, or data synchronization.

This hub documents real, commonly searched codes from widely used business software. Entries focus on what the code represents, what users typically see around it, and safe troubleshooting steps without overpromising outcomes.

BIOS/UEFI and boot diagnostics can appear as POST beeps, on-screen status codes, or firmware messages during startup. These identifiers often indicate the stage where initialization failed (memory, graphics, storage, security features).

This hub documents commonly referenced firmware and boot error identifiers in a conservative way. Pages avoid unsafe hardware instructions and emphasize manufacturer documentation, especially when electrical safety or component handling is involved.

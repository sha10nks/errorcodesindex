## Interpreting BIOS/UEFI diagnostics

Firmware signals are most useful when you capture the full context:

- The **device model** and firmware vendor (OEM vs motherboard vendor)
- The exact **beep pattern** or **displayed code/message**
- Whether the issue is **new** (after an update/change) or long-standing

Use official manuals and support resources for model-specific mappings. Avoid disassembling hardware unless you are qualified and following documented procedures.

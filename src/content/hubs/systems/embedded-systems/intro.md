Embedded systems appear in industrial controllers, appliances, kiosks, and specialized devices that run firmware-driven workflows. Errors may be shown as short numeric identifiers, status LEDs, or diagnostic messages intended for technicians.

This hub documents broadly recognized embedded-system error identifiers when they are reliably available. Content stays conservative and prioritizes safe steps, logs, and vendor service guidance for field equipment.

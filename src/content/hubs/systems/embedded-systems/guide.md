## Approaching embedded system errors

Embedded faults are often environment-dependent:

- Power quality and restart behavior
- Sensor inputs and device state
- Firmware versions and configuration

Safe first steps include confirming power and connections, capturing logs if available, and checking vendor documentation for the exact device model and firmware version.

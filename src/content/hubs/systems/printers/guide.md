## Reading printer errors

Printer faults usually fall into a few buckets:

- **Paper path** (jams, feed errors)
- **Consumables** (ink/toner, maintenance box)
- **Firmware/service** errors (often alphanumeric or “service error”)
- **Connectivity** (USB/network, driver issues)

Start with the display message, the code (if present), and whether the issue happens on-device or only from a specific computer.

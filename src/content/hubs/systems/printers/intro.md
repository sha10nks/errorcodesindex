Printer error codes often reflect mechanical state, consumables, firmware conditions, or communication issues between the printer and the host device. Many printers use short alphanumeric codes that repeat across model families, while some show message-style prompts instead.

This hub collects widely used printer error identifiers and organizes them into a consistent format. Entries prioritize safe steps like clearing queues, power-cycling, checking paper/ink states, and using vendor diagnostics rather than hardware disassembly.

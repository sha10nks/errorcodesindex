## How to read systems and device codes

Most system and device error identifiers fall into a few common patterns:

- **Hex codes** (for example, `0x8007…`) are typically OS or platform-level results.
- **Short alphanumeric codes** (for example, `B200`, `5B00`) are often device-family diagnostics.
- **Message-style errors** (for example, `Error 651`) are user-facing summaries that map to a lower-level failure.

When troubleshooting, prioritize reversible steps (retry, restart, confirm configuration, check logs) and avoid risky actions. For firmware, electrical, or safety-related scenarios, use manufacturer guidance and qualified service pathways.

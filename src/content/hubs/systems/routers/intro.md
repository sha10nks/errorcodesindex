Router and home-network issues are often shown as message-style errors, WAN/PPP status failures, or DNS/DHCP symptoms that prevent devices from reaching the internet. Some problems originate on the router, while others are upstream (ISP) or local (device configuration).

This hub documents common, widely recognized router and connectivity error identifiers and organizes them by what part of the connection is failing. Guidance stays conservative and focuses on safe network checks.

## Understanding router and connectivity errors

When troubleshooting connectivity, identify the failing hop:

- **Device → router** (Wi‑Fi association, DHCP)
- **Router → ISP** (WAN link, PPPoE)
- **Name resolution** (DNS)

Safe steps include power-cycling in the correct order (modem → router → device), checking WAN status lights, confirming DNS settings, and verifying whether multiple devices are affected.

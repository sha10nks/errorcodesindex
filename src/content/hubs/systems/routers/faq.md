### Is an “Error 651” always a router issue?
Not necessarily. It’s a common PPP connection message that can be triggered by ISP issues, device configuration, or modem/router problems.

### Should I reset my router to factory defaults?
Only if you have configuration backups and the router is manageable. Factory resets are disruptive and not always necessary.

### Do DNS errors mean the internet is down?
Not always. DNS failures can occur even when the WAN link is up.

### Why does the error change after reboot?
Different layers can fail on different attempts (DHCP, DNS, PPP). The most stable symptom is usually in the router status page.

### Are WAN/PPP codes vendor-specific?
Many PPP error messages are shared across platforms; router vendors may display them differently.

### What’s the safest first step?
Determine whether the issue affects one device or the whole network.

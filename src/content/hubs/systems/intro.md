Systems and devices report failures through short numeric codes, hexadecimal identifiers, and plain-language status messages. This section organizes those signals into a consistent reference, focused on what the code represents, where it usually appears, and what safe next steps typically look like.

You’ll find operating system and platform errors, firmware and boot diagnostics, and device-level fault codes from common hardware categories. Every page is written to be scannable, linkable, and stable, so you can move from a symptom to the right family of related codes without guessing.

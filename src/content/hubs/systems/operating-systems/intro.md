Operating system errors commonly appear as hexadecimal codes, update/installer identifiers, or short “status” messages shown by the OS, an installer, or a built-in troubleshooting tool. These identifiers often describe a failure class (permissions, missing files, component store issues) rather than a single cause.

This hub groups OS-level codes into a stable reference so you can identify what layer is failing and which checks are safest to try first. Pages favor conservative steps and point you back to logs and official repair paths when the code is too broad.

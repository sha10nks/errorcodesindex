Security-related failures can surface as login status codes, authentication errors, certificate validation problems, or policy blocks enforced by the operating system or a security product. These identifiers are often intentionally terse to reduce data leakage.

This hub documents commonly searched security error codes and what they generally represent, focusing on safe diagnostics. When a code’s meaning depends on private policy or internal logs, the page avoids speculation.

POS terminals and card-present devices can display short error prompts during authorization, settlement, batch close, or device pairing. Some identifiers are processor-related, while others reflect local configuration, connectivity, or device state.

This hub focuses on common, recognizable POS terminal error identifiers and what they typically indicate at a high level. Pages avoid guessing processor-specific meanings when the device only shows a generic prompt.

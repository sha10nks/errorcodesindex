### Are all terminal prompts standard?
No. Devices, gateways, and processors vary widely. This hub only includes identifiers that are commonly documented and searched.

### What’s the difference between “declined” and “error”?
Declines are payment decisions. Errors are technical failures (connectivity, configuration, or device state).

### Can a terminal show an error even if the payment went through?
Yes. Timeouts can occur after submission. Always confirm final status in the processor record.

### Should I re-run the card if I saw a timeout?
Confirm whether an authorization exists first to avoid duplicates.

### Do updates cause terminal errors?
They can, especially if keys or software updates are incomplete.

### What’s the safest first check?
Verify connectivity and confirm whether other terminals are impacted.

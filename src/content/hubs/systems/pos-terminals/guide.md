## Troubleshooting POS terminal errors

Start by separating these scenarios:

- **Payment decision** (decline vs technical failure)
- **Connectivity** (cellular/Wi‑Fi/Ethernet)
- **Batch/settlement** (end-of-day close)
- **Configuration** (TID/MID, keys, updates)

Safe steps include checking network signal, confirming the terminal has the correct merchant configuration, and reviewing processor dashboards for final transaction state.

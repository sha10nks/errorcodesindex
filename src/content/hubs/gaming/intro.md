Gaming error codes are platform and service responses that explain why a console, launcher, or online feature isn’t working as expected. They often point to sign-in problems, network conditions, store or licensing issues, corrupted installs, update mismatches, or temporary service outages.

This directory is meant to be a practical reference you can scan while you troubleshoot. Codes are grouped by recognizable families (WS-, NP-, SU-, CE-, plus common numeric patterns), and each page aims to translate the code into plain language and likely causes. When possible, the next steps are ordered from fastest checks to deeper fixes.

- Use quick navigation chips to jump to a code family you recognize
- Review common “can’t sign in / can’t download / can’t update” scenarios
- Check recently indexed pages for newly added platform and launcher issues
- Compare related codes that share symptoms but require different actions
- Follow the guide and FAQ for repeatable troubleshooting flow

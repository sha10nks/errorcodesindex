<p class="c1"><span class="c0">One-sentence summary</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This status indicates the account has restrictions that limit certain transactions or actions.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Account restricted&rdquo; indicates that the bank or platform has applied limitations to the account that prevent certain activities from being completed. Restrictions can be triggered by compliance requirements, risk controls, unresolved verification, policy enforcement, or administrative conditions. The restriction may apply only to specific actions (such as outgoing transfers) while other functions remain available. This status communicates permission constraints, not a specific transaction error like invalid amount or timeout. It does not automatically mean the account is closed or permanently disabled; it indicates that current permissions are reduced.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Where users usually see this code</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">When attempting to send transfers, add payees, or initiate payments</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In account settings or status banners</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In support or admin logs summarizing account eligibility</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Why this code usually appears</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Compliance or verification requirements are not satisfied</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Risk controls flagged account activity for restriction</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Policy rules limit actions based on account standing or usage patterns</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Administrative review or account state change is in effect</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What typically happens next</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Restricted actions are blocked and may display a generic restriction message</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The account may remain accessible for viewing balances and history</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The platform may require resolution steps through official channels before restoring full access</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code is NOT</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not a funds availability statement</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not the same as a system malfunction or outage</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not a guarantee that the restriction will lift automatically</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Related error codes</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">62 &mdash; Restricted card</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">ERR-AUTH &mdash; Authorization failed</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">ERR-LIMIT &mdash; Limit exceeded</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Verification failed &mdash; Identity or security verification not completed</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">05 &mdash; Do not honor</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Notes and edge cases</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Restriction scope can vary from narrow (only international transfers) to broad (multiple outgoing actions blocked). Some systems apply temporary restrictions during unusual activity periods, and users may see restrictions appear after repeated failed attempts. &ldquo;Restricted&rdquo; statuses are often intentionally non-specific in user-facing views. The most reliable details are typically available through the bank&rsquo;s official support pathways and account notices.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Optional next actions</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Review any account notices or status messages shown in the platform</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Confirm whether the restriction applies to one transaction type or multiple</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Document the timing and affected features for support reference</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Contact official support if the restriction prevents normal account use or persists</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">External help (optional)</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If an account restriction blocks critical transactions, official bank or platform support channels can clarify the restriction category and the steps required to restore access.</span></p>

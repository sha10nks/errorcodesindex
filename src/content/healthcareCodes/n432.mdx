<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">N432 is used to signal that essential data elements were not provided or were incomplete. The payer cannot fully adjudicate the claim without the missing information. This is an administrative issue rather than a coverage determination. The service itself may be covered once the information gap is resolved. The code serves as a clarification remark supporting other adjustment codes.</span></p>

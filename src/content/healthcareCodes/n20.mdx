<p class="c1"><span class="c0">N20 is a remark code used to indicate that payment is not allowed for the billed service. It provides additional context but does not independently determine coverage. The code reflects payer policy rather than claim submission errors. It does not specify whether the service is excluded permanently or conditionally. N20 is typically paired with an adjustment reason code explaining the primary decision.</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">M20 is applied when CMS identifies missing or incomplete information needed to adjudicate a claim. This is an administrative issue rather than a coverage determination. The service may still be eligible for payment once information is complete. The code supports other adjustment or denial codes.</span></p>

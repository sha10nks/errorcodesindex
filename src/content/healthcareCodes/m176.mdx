<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">M176 is used when a payer determines that a service falls outside covered benefits and is excluded by policy. This is a plan design or program rule, not a billing format issue. The exclusion applies regardless of how the service was billed. The code does not imply that the service was unnecessary or incorrectly performed. Coverage exclusions vary by program and payer.</span></p>

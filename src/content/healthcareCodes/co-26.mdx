<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">CO-26 is used when a payer determines that expenses were incurred outside the active coverage period. Coverage effective dates define when benefits apply. Services provided before coverage begins are typically not reimbursable. This is a coverage timing issue rather than a billing or documentation error. It does not reflect on service quality.</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">CO-52 is applied when payer rules require a provider signature and it is not present or not validated. Signatures confirm authorization and accountability. This is an administrative compliance issue rather than a coverage determination. The claim may be eligible for reprocessing once signature requirements are met.</span></p>

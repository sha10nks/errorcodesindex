<p class="c1"><span class="c0">CO-119 is used when benefit limits defined by the plan have been exhausted. Benefit maximums restrict how much coverage is available within a defined period. This is a plan design feature rather than a billing error. Additional services may not be reimbursed once limits are reached.</span></p>

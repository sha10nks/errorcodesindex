<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This code indicates that the service is excluded from coverage under the patient&rsquo;s insurance plan.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">CO-204 is applied when a payer determines that a specific service is not included in the plan&rsquo;s covered benefits. The denial is based on plan design rather than claim submission accuracy. It reflects an exclusion or limitation within the policy. This does not imply that the service was unnecessary or incorrectly provided. Coverage exclusions vary by plan type and policy terms.</span></p>

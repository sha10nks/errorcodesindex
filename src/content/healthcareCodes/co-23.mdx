<p class="c1"><span class="c0">CO-23 is used when a payer considers the outcome of another payer&rsquo;s adjudication. This reflects coordination of benefits processing. The code does not independently determine coverage. It clarifies that payment decisions account for prior payments or denials. Final reimbursement depends on payer order and rules.</span></p>

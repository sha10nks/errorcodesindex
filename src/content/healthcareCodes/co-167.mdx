<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This code indicates that no valid authorization was found for a service that requires prior approval.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">CO-167 is used when payer systems cannot locate an authorization record associated with the billed service. Authorization is often required to confirm coverage eligibility before services are rendered. The absence of an authorization affects payment eligibility. This code reflects administrative policy enforcement rather than service quality. It does not indicate an error in service delivery.</span></p>

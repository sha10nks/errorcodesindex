<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This code indicates that the service is not included as a covered benefit under the patient&rsquo;s insurance policy.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">CO-97 is applied when an insurer determines that a billed service is not a covered benefit according to the plan&rsquo;s benefit structure. This decision is based on plan design rather than claim submission accuracy. The code signals that payment is not allowed for this service under the current policy. It does not suggest that documentation was missing or that the claim failed technical validation. The service itself may be covered under other plans or policies but not under the one applied to the claim.</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Why this code usually appears</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The plan excludes the specific service category</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The service is covered only under certain plan tiers</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The benefit applies only after specific conditions are met</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What typically happens next</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The insurer denies payment for the service</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The balance may transfer to patient responsibility</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The claim is finalized without further processing</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code is NOT</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not a documentation or coding error</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not related to authorization timing</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Verify coverage details in the plan document</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Check for alternate coverage pathways</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">N30 is used to clarify that patient responsibility applies to part or all of the adjudicated charge. It does not determine coverage on its own but provides additional context to other adjustment or responsibility codes. The code signals that the payer has completed its portion of adjudication and that remaining amounts fall under patient cost-sharing obligations. It does not specify the type of responsibility, such as deductible or coinsurance. N30 functions as an informational remark rather than a denial reason.</span></p>

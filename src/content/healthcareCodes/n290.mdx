<p class="c1"><span class="c0">N290 is applied when provider identifiers do not meet payer requirements. Accurate provider identification is necessary for claim adjudication. This remark indicates a data validation issue rather than a coverage decision. The claim may be eligible for reprocessing once corrected. It does not imply that the service is non-covered.</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">PR-1 reflects the portion of the claim that the patient is responsible for under their deductible. Deductibles represent amounts patients must pay before insurance coverage begins. This is a standard cost-sharing mechanism, not a denial. The service itself may be covered, but payment is applied toward deductible limits.</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">N151 is used when the payer determines that supporting documentation necessary for adjudication is missing. This is an administrative requirement related to claim review. The code does not indicate that the service is non-covered. It reflects that the payer cannot complete processing without additional records. Documentation standards vary by payer and service type.</span></p>

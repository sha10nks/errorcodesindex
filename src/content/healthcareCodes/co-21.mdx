<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">CO-21 is applied when the place of service code does not meet payer requirements. Place of service identifies where care was provided and affects reimbursement. Incorrect or missing values prevent accurate adjudication. This is a data validation issue rather than a coverage decision. The service may be eligible once corrected.</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This code indicates that information submitted on the claim is inconsistent across data elements.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">N345 is used when payer systems detect conflicting or mismatched information within a claim. This may involve discrepancies between demographic, service, diagnosis, or provider data. The issue is administrative and relates to data consistency rather than coverage eligibility. The payer cannot reliably adjudicate the claim while inconsistencies exist. The code does not imply that the service itself is non-covered.</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">N152 is used to clarify that a reduction was applied to the claim payment. It does not independently determine coverage or responsibility. The reduction reflects payer policies such as fee schedules or benefit calculations. The code does not specify the reason for the reduction by itself. Additional codes typically provide further detail.</span></p>

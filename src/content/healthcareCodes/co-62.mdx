<p class="c1"><span class="c0">CO-62 is used when a payer restricts coverage based on where the service was provided. Place of service affects reimbursement eligibility. This is a policy enforcement decision rather than a billing format issue. The service may be covered in a different setting under the same plan.</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">CO-54 is applied when a claim reflects services billed by more than one physician where payer policy allows only a single billing provider. This determination is based on reimbursement rules rather than service quality. The code enforces payer limitations on how services may be billed. It does not imply that the service was unnecessary or incorrectly performed. The issue relates to billing structure and provider eligibility.</span></p>

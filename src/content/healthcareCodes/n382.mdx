<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">N382 is used when the provider identified on the claim is not recognized as eligible or correct for the service billed. This may relate to enrollment status, provider role, or identifier mismatches. The issue is administrative rather than a coverage decision. The service may still be covered if submitted under the correct provider.</span></p>

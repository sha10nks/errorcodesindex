<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">N164 is used when essential claim data is absent. Without complete data, the payer cannot finalize adjudication. This is an administrative completeness issue rather than a coverage determination. The service may still be eligible once data requirements are met.</span></p>

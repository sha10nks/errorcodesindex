<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This code indicates that one or more billed charges are not covered under the patient&rsquo;s insurance plan.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">CO-96 is used when specific charges on a claim are excluded from coverage based on plan benefits. The service itself may have been validly provided, but the plan does not reimburse for that charge type. This code can apply to entire services or specific components of a billed line. It does not imply that the claim was incorrectly submitted. It also does not automatically assign fault to the provider or patient.</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Why this code usually appears</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The plan excludes the billed charge category</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The service exceeds coverage limitations</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benefit restrictions apply to the charge</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What typically happens next</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The payer denies payment for the charge</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Responsibility may transfer to the patient</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The claim line is closed</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code is NOT</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not a coding format error</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not a temporary hold</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Notes and edge cases</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Some plans cover charges only when bundled with other services. Secondary insurance may change final responsibility. Coverage exclusions can vary widely by policy.</span></p>

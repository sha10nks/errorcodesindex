<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">CO-16 is applied when essential data elements are absent or incomplete on a claim. The insurer cannot complete adjudication without the missing information. This is a technical or administrative issue rather than a coverage decision. It does not imply the service is not covered. Once the required information is provided, the claim may be eligible for reprocessing.</span></p>

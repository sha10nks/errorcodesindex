<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">AAA-79 is returned when the participant ID does not conform to payer requirements or cannot be validated. The participant ID is used to uniquely identify an individual within the eligibility system. When invalid, eligibility processing cannot continue. This does not imply that coverage is absent. It reflects an identifier validation failure.</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">N286 signals that documentation needed to support claim adjudication was not provided or did not meet requirements. This is an administrative issue rather than a coverage determination. The payer cannot complete review without sufficient documentation. The service itself may still be eligible for payment once documentation is received.</span></p>

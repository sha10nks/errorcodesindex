<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">CO-45 reflects a contractual adjustment where the provider&rsquo;s billed amount is higher than the payer&rsquo;s allowed amount. The insurer reduces the payment to align with the negotiated fee schedule. This is a common contractual adjustment and does not represent a denial of the service itself. It also does not indicate that the service was unnecessary or incorrectly coded. The adjustment is based on pre-established reimbursement rates.</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">CO-109 is used when the insurer determines it is not the correct payer for the claim. Coverage may exist under another insurer or plan. This is a payer responsibility determination, not a service denial. The claim itself may be valid but directed to the wrong payer. It does not imply improper billing.</span></p>

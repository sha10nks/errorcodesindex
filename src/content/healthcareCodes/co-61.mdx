<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This code indicates that the procedure is not covered for the patient&rsquo;s age under the payer&rsquo;s policy.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">CO-61 is applied when a payer determines that a procedure does not meet age-related coverage criteria. Coverage rules often include age limits for certain services. This determination is policy-based rather than a billing error. It does not imply that the procedure was inappropriate. Coverage eligibility depends on payer-defined age parameters.</span></p>

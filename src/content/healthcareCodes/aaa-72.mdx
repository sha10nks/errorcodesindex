<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">AAA-72 is returned when the eligibility system cannot match the patient details provided in the 270 inquiry to any record on file. This response reflects a data matching issue rather than a coverage determination. It does not indicate that the patient lacks insurance coverage. The issue arises at the identification stage before eligibility can be assessed. Small discrepancies in patient information can prevent successful matching.</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">CO-29 is applied when a claim exceeds the allowed time frame for submission. Filing limits are set by payer policy and contract terms. Once expired, claims are typically not eligible for payment. This is an administrative determination, not a coverage decision. Exceptions are uncommon and payer-specific.</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This code indicates that the claim was submitted after the payer&rsquo;s allowed filing time limit.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">CO-29 is applied when a claim is received beyond the payer&rsquo;s established timely filing deadline. Filing limits are defined by payer policy or contractual agreement and are enforced during adjudication. This determination is administrative and does not relate to the service itself. It does not imply that the service was unnecessary or incorrectly billed. Once the filing window has closed, reimbursement is typically no longer available.</span></p>

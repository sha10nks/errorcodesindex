<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">AAA-75 is returned when the subscriber record cannot be matched during an eligibility inquiry. The subscriber is typically the policyholder under whose coverage the patient is enrolled. This response occurs before eligibility determination and reflects a data identification issue. It does not indicate that coverage is inactive or terminated. The system cannot proceed without locating the subscriber record.</span></p>

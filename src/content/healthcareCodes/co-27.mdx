<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This code indicates that the patient&rsquo;s insurance coverage was not active on the date of service.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">CO-27 is applied when a payer determines that coverage had ended before the service date. The claim is denied because the policy was no longer in force at the time services were rendered. This is a coverage status issue rather than a service-level determination. It does not indicate that the service was inappropriate or incorrectly billed. Coverage termination may occur due to policy expiration, cancellation, or eligibility changes.</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Why this code usually appears</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Policy coverage ended prior to service date</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Eligibility records were not updated in time</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What typically happens next</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Responsibility may shift to another insurer or the patient</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The claim is closed unless redirected</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code is NOT</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not a non-covered service determination</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not a billing format error</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not a temporary processing delay</span></p>

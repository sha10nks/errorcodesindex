<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">AAA-82 is returned when the subscriber ID cannot be validated against payer records. The subscriber ID identifies the primary policyholder. If invalid, the system cannot assess eligibility. This response occurs before coverage evaluation and reflects data validation issues rather than benefit status.</span></p>

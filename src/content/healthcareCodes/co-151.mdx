<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">CO-151 represents a contractual adjustment applied under negotiated reimbursement terms. The payer reduces the billed amount to match agreed-upon contract rates. This is a standard adjustment and does not indicate an error or denial. It reflects contractual obligations rather than coverage limitations. The adjusted amount is typically not billable to the patient.</span></p>

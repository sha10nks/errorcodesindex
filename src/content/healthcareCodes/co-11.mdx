<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">CO-11 is used when the diagnosis code submitted does not align with the procedure under payer policy. Payers apply clinical policy logic to determine whether reported diagnoses justify billed services. This is a policy-based determination rather than a billing format issue. It does not automatically indicate incorrect care. Coverage decisions depend on diagnosis&ndash;procedure relationships defined by the payer.</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This code indicates that the reported service is inconsistent with the modifier submitted on the claim line.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">CO-4 is used when a payer determines that a procedure or service does not logically align with the modifier attached to it. Modifiers provide additional context about how or why a service was performed, and payers rely on them to adjudicate claims accurately. When the modifier conflicts with the service description or payer rules, processing cannot proceed as billed. This does not automatically mean the service was invalid or unnecessary. It reflects a mismatch between reported information rather than a coverage decision.</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claim detail views in payer portals</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Why this code usually appears</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">An incorrect modifier was appended to the service</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The modifier is not applicable to the reported procedure</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Payer-specific modifier rules were not met</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What typically happens next</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The claim line is denied or rejected</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Reprocessing may be possible with corrected information</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Payment is delayed until alignment is resolved</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code is NOT</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not a non-covered service determination</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not a contractual adjustment</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not an assessment of medical necessity</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Notes and edge cases</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Modifier requirements vary significantly between payers. Some systems apply automated logic checks that flag inconsistencies immediately. Certain modifiers are valid only under specific clinical or billing scenarios.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Optional next actions</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Review payer modifier guidelines</span></p>

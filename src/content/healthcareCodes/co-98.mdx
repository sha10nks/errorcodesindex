<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">CO-98 is applied when payer systems identify that the charges were previously adjudicated. This prevents duplicate processing. The code reflects claim history rather than coverage status. It does not imply billing errors or service issues. The original adjudication outcome remains valid.</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">CO-31 is used when patient identification details do not match payer records. Accurate identification is required for claim processing. When discrepancies occur, adjudication cannot proceed. This code reflects a data matching issue rather than a coverage or service determination. It does not imply that coverage does not exist.</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">CO-22 is applied when payer systems suggest that another insurer may have primary responsibility. This relates to coordination of benefits. The code does not deny the service itself. It indicates that payer order needs clarification. Coverage may exist under another plan.</span></p>

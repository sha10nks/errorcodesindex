<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">M184 is applied when the payer cannot validate the patient identified on the claim. This reflects an identification or data matching issue rather than a coverage determination. The service may be covered once patient information is corrected. The code does not imply that the service itself is invalid. Accurate patient identification is required for adjudication.</span></p>

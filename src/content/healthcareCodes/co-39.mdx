<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">CO-39 is used when a payer determines that a service does not meet coverage criteria due to its experimental or investigational status. Coverage policies define which services qualify for reimbursement. This determination is based on policy guidelines rather than claim submission quality. It does not imply improper billing or service delivery. Coverage decisions may differ between payers.</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">CO-178 is applied when submitted claim data does not provide enough information for the payer to determine coverage or payment. This is an administrative completeness issue rather than a coverage denial. The service may be eligible once sufficient information is provided. The code supports other adjustment or remark codes explaining the deficiency.</span></p>

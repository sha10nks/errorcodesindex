<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">M114 is applied when CMS determines that diagnosis information necessary for adjudication was not provided. Diagnosis data supports coverage and payment decisions. This is an administrative completeness issue rather than a coverage denial. The claim may be eligible for reprocessing once diagnosis data is complete.</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">M212 is applied when required elements are missing from the claim submission. CMS cannot adjudicate incomplete claims. This is an administrative completeness issue rather than a coverage determination. Once completed, the claim may be eligible for reprocessing.</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">CO-69 is used when a claim exceeds expected service duration thresholds. Payers apply outlier rules to adjust reimbursement. This reflects payment methodology rather than coverage denial. It does not indicate improper care. Adjustments are based on predefined benchmarks.</span></p>

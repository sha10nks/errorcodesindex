<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This code indicates that required claim data was missing for CMS processing.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">M170 is applied when CMS cannot adjudicate a claim due to missing data. This is an administrative completeness issue rather than a coverage determination. The claim may be eligible for reprocessing once required data is supplied.</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not patient responsibility</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not a contractual adjustment</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">CO-133 is applied when the provider type reported is not eligible to bill for the service under payer rules. Provider eligibility is defined by enrollment and scope of practice. This is an administrative validation issue rather than a coverage decision. The service itself may be valid but billed under an ineligible provider type.</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Title</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">(766 &mdash; Credit to account)</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">One-sentence summary</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This code indicates that a credit has been applied to the taxpayer&rsquo;s account for the specified tax period.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Code 766 reflects that a credit amount has been posted to the account. Credits may originate from refundable credits claimed on the return, payments made, or adjustments processed by the IRS. The code represents the application of a credit that reduces the balance due or increases a potential refund. It does not specify the source of the credit unless additional context appears elsewhere on the transcript. The presence of code 766 does not automatically indicate a refund has been issued; it indicates a credit has been recorded.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Where users usually see this code</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">On IRS account transcripts under transaction codes</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Following processing of refundable credits</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">During review of account activity for a tax year</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Why this code usually appears</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">A refundable credit was claimed and processed</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">A payment or credit adjustment was applied</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The IRS posted a correction resulting in a credit</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">A carryover or prior adjustment was applied to the account</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What typically happens next</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The account balance may decrease or show an overpayment</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Additional refund-related codes may post if applicable</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Further adjustments may appear if review continues</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code is NOT</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not confirmation of refund issuance</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not an audit indicator</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It does not specify the reason for the credit without supporting codes</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Related error codes</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">768 &mdash; Earned income credit</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">846 &mdash; Refund issued</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">290 &mdash; Additional tax assessed</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">291 &mdash; Reduced tax assessed</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">971 &mdash; Notice issued</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Notes and edge cases</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Multiple 766 entries may appear if several credits were applied separately. The amount associated with the code reflects the credit applied at that posting date. Credits may later be adjusted or offset depending on account activity. Reviewing the entire transcript provides context for how the credit affects the overall balance.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Optional next actions</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Review the credit amount listed next to the code</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Check for refund issuance codes following the credit</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Confirm whether additional adjustments appear afterward</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Consult official IRS resources if clarification is needed</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">External help (optional)</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If the source of the credit is unclear, official IRS resources or authorized tax professionals may assist in interpreting transcript entries.</span></p>

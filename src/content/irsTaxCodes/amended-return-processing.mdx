<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Amended return processing&rdquo; reflects that a revised return has been received and is under review. The status signals that changes are being evaluated before final account adjustments. It does not confirm acceptance or denial of revised amounts. Processing timelines for amended returns are generally longer than original returns. Transcript entries such as 977 may accompany this stage.</span></p>

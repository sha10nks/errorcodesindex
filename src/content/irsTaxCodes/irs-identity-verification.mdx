<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;IRS identity verification&rdquo; reflects that additional steps are required to confirm the taxpayer&rsquo;s identity. It may appear in status tools or be associated with transcript entries and notices. The requirement pauses processing until verification procedures are completed. The status does not imply wrongdoing; it represents compliance and security procedures. Processing resumes after identity confirmation is resolved.</span></p>

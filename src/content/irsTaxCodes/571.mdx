<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This code indicates that a previously pending account issue has been resolved by the IRS.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Code 571 reflects that an earlier account-level hold or pending action has been completed. It often follows code 570 or similar review indicators and signals that the internal issue has been addressed. The code itself does not specify what the issue was; it indicates resolution of that issue within IRS systems. The presence of code 571 may allow refund processing or account updates to proceed. It does not automatically confirm that a refund has been issued, but it indicates movement toward normal processing.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Where users usually see this code</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">On IRS account transcripts following code 570</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After a period of pending review</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">During review of transaction code history for a tax year</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Why this code usually appears</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Internal account action associated with 570 has been completed</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Verification or reconciliation steps were finalized</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">System processing has cleared the pending hold</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Review workflow reached a resolution stage</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What typically happens next</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Refund issuance codes may post if applicable</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The account may update with adjustment or payment entries</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Processing may continue under normal workflow</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code is NOT</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not a refund issuance code by itself</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Notes and edge cases</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Code 571 often appears close in timing to the pending code it resolves. In some cases, resolution may not immediately result in refund issuance if other holds remain. Multiple resolution entries can appear if multiple pending actions were recorded. The transcript should be reviewed in full to understand context.</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">External help (optional)</span></p>

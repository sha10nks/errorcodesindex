<p class="c1"><span class="c0">CODE: 768</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Title</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">(768 &mdash; Earned income credit)</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">One-sentence summary</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This code indicates the Earned Income Credit has been applied to the taxpayer&rsquo;s account.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Code 768 reflects the posting of the Earned Income Credit (EIC) to the account. This is a refundable credit that may increase a refund or reduce a balance due. The code represents the recording of the credit amount associated with the return. It does not confirm refund issuance by itself, nor does it indicate whether additional review is underway. It simply shows that the EIC amount has been processed and posted to the transcript.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Where users usually see this code</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">On an IRS account transcript under transaction codes</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After refundable credits are processed</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">During review of transcript activity for the tax year</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Why this code usually appears</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The taxpayer claimed the Earned Income Credit</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The IRS processed and approved the EIC amount</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Account adjustments included EIC posting</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The return included qualifying income and dependent information</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What typically happens next</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Additional credits may post</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">A refund issuance code may appear if overpayment exists</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Review-related codes may appear if verification is required</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code is NOT</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not a refund issuance confirmation</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not an audit notice</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It does not guarantee immediate payment</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Related error codes</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">766 &mdash; Credit to account</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">846 &mdash; Refund issued</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">570 &mdash; Additional account action pending</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">971 &mdash; Notice issued</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">290 &mdash; Additional tax assessed</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Notes and edge cases</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">EIC-related returns may undergo additional review depending on IRS verification procedures. The presence of code 768 alone does not indicate delay or approval beyond posting. The credit amount is reflected next to the code entry. Transcript cycle dates may provide timing context for processing stages.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Optional next actions</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Review the posted credit amount</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Monitor for refund issuance entries</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Check for additional review-related codes</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Consult official IRS resources if further clarification is needed</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">External help (optional)</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If questions arise about credit posting or refund timing, official IRS channels or authorized tax professionals may provide guidance based on transcript details.</span></p>

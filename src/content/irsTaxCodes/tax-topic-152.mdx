<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tax Topic 152 is a general informational reference associated with refund processing. It indicates that the return has been received and is moving through standard processing stages. The topic does not signal a problem, freeze, or denial by itself. It provides general information about refund timelines and methods. Its presence typically reflects routine processing activity within IRS systems.</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">External help (optional)</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If refund status remains unclear, official IRS resources or authorized tax professionals may help interpret processing indicators.</span></p>

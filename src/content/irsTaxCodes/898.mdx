<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This code indicates that all or part of the refund was applied to a debt through the Treasury Offset Program.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Code 898 reflects that a refund was offset and applied toward an outstanding federal or state obligation. This transaction indicates that the refund amount was reduced by the offset amount. It does not indicate the nature of the debt in the code itself. The presence of code 898 means the refund was not issued in full because an offset occurred. The transcript entry will typically show the offset amount.</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Refund approved but not sent&rdquo; reflects a transitional stage between approval and payment transmission. It indicates that IRS systems have completed processing but payment release has not occurred. The status does not indicate denial or freeze. It represents a normal sequence stage prior to issuance. The transcript may later show refund issuance codes once payment is processed.</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">One-sentence summary</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This code indicates that an amended tax return has been received and recorded by the IRS.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Code 977 reflects that the IRS has received and posted an amended return for the tax year. It indicates that account processing includes changes submitted after the original filing. This code records the amended return entry into IRS systems but does not confirm acceptance of all changes. It does not specify whether additional tax is due or a refund is generated. It signals that amendment processing has begun at the account level.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Where users usually see this code</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">On IRS account transcripts</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After submitting an amended return</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">During review of transcript entries for updated filings</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Why this code usually appears</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">An amended return was filed</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The IRS recorded changes to the tax account</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Processing of revised information began</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The account reflects updated filing status</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What typically happens next</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Additional adjustment codes may appear</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tax amounts may increase or decrease depending on review</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Refund or balance updates may follow</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code is NOT</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not confirmation of amendment approval</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not a refund issuance</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not an examination code</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Related error codes</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">290 &mdash; Additional tax assessed</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">291 &mdash; Reduced tax assessed</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">846 &mdash; Refund issued</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">971 &mdash; Notice issued</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">150 &mdash; Return filed</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Notes and edge cases</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Amended return processing can take longer than original returns. Code 977 reflects receipt and posting, not completion. Additional entries are often required before final account balance updates appear. Reviewing subsequent transcript entries provides context.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Optional next actions</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Monitor transcript for adjustment codes</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Review whether refund or balance changes appear</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Keep documentation related to amended return</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Consult official IRS resources if needed</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">External help (optional)</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If amendment processing status is unclear, official IRS resources or authorized tax professionals may provide guidance.</span></p>

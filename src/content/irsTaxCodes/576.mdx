<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Title</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">(576 &mdash; Fraud hold)</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">One-sentence summary</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This code indicates the IRS has applied a hold due to potential fraud review considerations.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Code 576 reflects that the account has been placed under a fraud-related hold. This status indicates that the IRS is conducting review procedures associated with identity verification or fraud detection protocols. The code does not represent a final fraud determination; it signals that processing is paused pending review. Refund issuance is typically halted while the hold remains active. The presence of code 576 alone does not describe the nature or outcome of the review.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Where users usually see this code</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">On IRS account transcripts under transaction codes</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">During refund processing when a hold has been applied</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In combination with other review or freeze codes</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Why this code usually appears</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Identity verification procedures were triggered</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fraud detection systems flagged account activity</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Return information requires additional review</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Internal compliance review was initiated</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What typically happens next</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Processing pauses until review is completed</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Resolution codes may post once review concludes</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Refund-related entries may appear after hold release</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code is NOT</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not confirmation of fraud</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not a final denial of refund</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not automatically an audit code</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Related error codes</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">810 &mdash; Refund freeze</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">570 &mdash; Additional account action pending</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">571 &mdash; Issue resolved</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">572 &mdash; Refund hold released</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">420 &mdash; Examination initiated</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Notes and edge cases</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fraud-related holds can vary in duration depending on review complexity. The transcript may not specify the reason beyond the code itself. In some cases, identity verification procedures may occur outside the transcript before resolution codes post. The cycle date provides general context but not final timing.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Optional next actions</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Monitor the transcript for resolution or release codes</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Review official IRS communications regarding identity verification</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Avoid assuming final outcome until additional entries appear</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Consult official IRS resources if uncertainty persists</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">External help (optional)</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If fraud hold codes remain unresolved, official IRS communication channels or authorized tax professionals may help clarify account status and next procedural steps.</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This code indicates the IRS has placed the account into a pending status while additional internal action or review is being completed.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Code 570 reflects that the IRS has paused normal processing because additional account-level action is required. This may involve verification, internal review, reconciliation of reported amounts, or other administrative processing steps. The code signals that the return or refund cannot proceed until the pending action is resolved. It does not specify the exact reason for the hold and does not automatically indicate an audit or fraud determination. It represents a temporary processing state while the IRS completes required account actions.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Where users usually see this code</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">On an IRS account transcript under transaction entries</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">During refund processing when progress appears paused</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After return filing when additional review steps are initiated</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Why this code usually appears</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The IRS identified information requiring verification</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Account reconciliation or adjustment review is pending</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Automated review processes flagged an item for further action</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Refund issuance is temporarily paused pending resolution</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What typically happens next</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">A resolving code such as 571 or 572 may post once action is completed</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The account may update with refund issuance or adjustment entries</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Additional transaction codes may appear indicating review outcomes</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code is NOT</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not confirmation of an audit by itself</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not a refund denial</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not a final account adjustment</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Related error codes</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">571 &mdash; Issue resolved</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">572 &mdash; Refund hold released</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">152 &mdash; Refund freeze notice</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">810 &mdash; Refund freeze</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">420 &mdash; Examination initiated</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Notes and edge cases</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Code 570 may remain on the transcript until a corresponding resolution code posts. The time between 570 and resolution varies depending on workload and review complexity. In some cases, multiple 570 entries can appear for the same tax year if additional actions occur. The cycle date associated with the entry may provide timing context but does not guarantee resolution speed.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Optional next actions</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Monitor the transcript for resolution codes such as 571 or 572</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Review whether additional review-related codes appear</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Avoid assuming final outcome until further updates post</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If extended delays occur, consult official IRS resources</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">External help (optional)</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If code 570 remains unresolved for an extended period, official IRS communication channels or authorized tax professionals may help interpret the account status.</span></p>

This may involve identity verification, compliance checks, or administrative reconciliation. The code signals that processing cannot proceed until the pending action is resolved. It does not specify the review type within the code itself. The presence of 570 represents a temporary processing status.</span></p>

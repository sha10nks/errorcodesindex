<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Refund freeze lifted&rdquo; reflects that the IRS has cleared a prior hold that prevented refund issuance. It signals that the account is no longer in the frozen state. This status allows refund processing to continue. It does not guarantee immediate payment but indicates removal of the blocking condition. Transcript entries such as 811 or 572 may accompany this change.</span></p>

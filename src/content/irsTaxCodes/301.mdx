<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Code 301 reflects a reduction in assessed tax, often following examination or adjustment procedures. It represents the official posting of a decreased liability amount on the transcript. The code indicates that prior assessments were modified to lower the total owed. It does not by itself confirm refund issuance, but it may result in reduced balance or overpayment status. The associated entry shows the amount reduced.</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Code 670 reflects that the IRS has recorded a payment toward the tax account for the specified period. The entry represents receipt and posting of funds, reducing any outstanding balance due. It does not indicate whether the payment fully satisfies the balance or whether additional amounts remain outstanding. The code shows payment activity at the account level but does not specify the payment method within the code itself. It confirms that funds were applied to the account as of the transaction date.</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Refund still processing&rdquo; reflects an ongoing processing state rather than a transaction code. It indicates that the return remains under review within IRS systems. The status does not confirm approval or denial of the refund. It represents an intermediate stage while processing continues. The phrase signals that no final refund issuance has occurred yet.</span></p>

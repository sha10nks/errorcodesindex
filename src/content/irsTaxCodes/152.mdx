<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Title</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">(152 &mdash; Refund freeze notice)</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">One-sentence summary</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This code indicates a temporary hold has been placed on the refund during processing.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Code 152 reflects that a refund-related freeze has been applied to the account while the IRS completes processing or review steps. This code is often associated with standard refund processing messages and may not indicate a problem by itself. In many cases, it appears while the IRS verifies return information or completes internal review procedures before issuing a refund. The presence of code 152 does not automatically mean the refund is denied or under examination. It represents a processing state in which the refund is not yet released.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Where users usually see this code</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">On an IRS account transcript under transaction codes</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">During periods when refund status shows standard processing messages</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After a return has been filed and entered into processing</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Why this code usually appears</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Refund processing is underway but not yet finalized</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Internal verification procedures are being completed</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The system has not yet authorized release of the refund</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The return is in a normal processing queue</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What typically happens next</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Additional codes may post indicating release of the refund</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The freeze may be lifted once processing is complete</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The account may update with a refund issuance code</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code is NOT</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not confirmation of an audit</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not a denial of the refund</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not proof of fraud determination</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Related error codes</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">570 &mdash; Additional account action pending</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">571 &mdash; Issue resolved</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">572 &mdash; Refund hold released</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">810 &mdash; Refund freeze</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">150 &mdash; Return filed</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Notes and edge cases</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Code 152 is commonly seen during routine processing and does not necessarily signal a delay beyond standard timeframes. The code can remain on the transcript until another transaction updates the account. In some situations, additional review codes may appear alongside 152, which may indicate further processing steps. The cycle date associated with transcript entries can provide context for timing expectations.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Optional next actions</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Continue monitoring transcript updates for release-related codes</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Review whether additional transaction codes appear</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Avoid assuming a negative outcome based solely on code 152</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If processing extends beyond typical expectations, consult official IRS resources</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">External help (optional)</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If a refund freeze remains in place without updates for an extended period, official IRS communication channels or authorized tax professionals may help interpret transcript activity.</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This code indicates that the IRS has placed a freeze on the refund, preventing it from being issued.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Code 810 reflects that the IRS has applied a formal refund freeze to the account. This freeze prevents the refund from being released while specific review or administrative procedures are conducted. The code can be associated with various internal review categories, including compliance or verification processes. It signals that the refund cannot proceed until the freeze is lifted. The code does not, by itself, provide the reason for the freeze or its expected duration.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Where users usually see this code</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">On IRS account transcripts under transaction entries</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">During refund processing when issuance is delayed</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In conjunction with other review-related codes</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Why this code usually appears</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Internal review or verification is required</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fraud or compliance screening triggered a freeze</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Administrative action requires suspension of refund release</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Account reconciliation is pending</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What typically happens next</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Refund processing remains paused</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">A release code such as 572 may post when freeze is lifted</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Additional review or examination codes may appear</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code is NOT</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not a refund denial notice</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not proof of fraud determination</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It does not specify payment timing</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Notes and edge cases</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Code 810 may remain on the transcript until resolved by subsequent entries. The duration of the freeze depends on review processes and workload. In some cases, multiple freeze-related codes can appear for the same tax period. Reviewing the transcript as a whole is important to understand context.</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Consult official IRS resources if clarification is needed</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">External help (optional)</span></p>

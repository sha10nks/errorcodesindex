<p class="c1"><span class="c0">One-sentence summary</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This code indicates the tax return has been referred to an examination unit for further review.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Code 424 reflects that the return has been referred to an examination function for additional review. It typically precedes or accompanies an examination-related action. This code indicates that the account has been flagged for review consideration but does not itself confirm final examination decisions. It is part of the IRS internal workflow and signals movement toward examination processing. The code does not indicate outcome, liability change, or refund denial by itself.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Where users usually see this code</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">On IRS account transcripts</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In conjunction with other examination-related transaction codes</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">During review of account activity</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Why this code usually appears</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The return met criteria requiring examination referral</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Internal review processes flagged items for escalation</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Additional scrutiny was required beyond standard processing</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Risk or compliance filters triggered examination routing</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What typically happens next</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The account may receive code 420 indicating examination initiation</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Correspondence may be issued</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Refund processing may pause during review</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code is NOT</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not a refund issuance code</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not a final audit determination</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not a guarantee of adjustment</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Related error codes</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">420 &mdash; Examination initiated</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">570 &mdash; Additional account action pending</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">576 &mdash; Fraud hold</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">571 &mdash; Issue resolved</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">810 &mdash; Refund freeze</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Notes and edge cases</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Code 424 can appear before a formal examination is opened. In some cases, the referral may not result in extended examination if resolved quickly. The transcript cycle dates provide context for when referral occurred. The code does not specify the scope of review.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Optional next actions</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Monitor the transcript for additional examination-related codes</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Review official IRS notices for further information</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Avoid assuming final outcome based solely on referral</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Use official IRS communication channels for clarification if needed</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">External help (optional)</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If referral codes generate uncertainty, official IRS guidance or authorized tax professionals may provide interpretation based on transcript context.</span></p>

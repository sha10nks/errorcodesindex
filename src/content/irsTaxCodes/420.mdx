<p class="c1"><span class="c0">One-sentence summary</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This code indicates the IRS has initiated an examination process for the tax return.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Code 420 appears when the IRS has opened an examination, commonly referred to as an audit, for the tax period listed. It reflects that the return has been selected for further review beyond standard processing. This code does not provide details about the scope or outcome of the examination; it simply indicates that an examination process has begun. The presence of code 420 does not automatically imply wrongdoing. It signals that additional review procedures are underway.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Where users usually see this code</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">On an IRS account transcript under transaction codes</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After a return has been flagged for examination</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">During review of tax account activity for a specific year</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Why this code usually appears</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The return was selected for examination based on IRS criteria</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">System review flagged items for further scrutiny</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Referral from another review unit occurred</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Compliance verification procedures triggered examination</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What typically happens next</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The IRS may issue correspondence regarding examination details</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Processing of refunds may pause depending on circumstances</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Additional transcript codes may post reflecting examination actions</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code is NOT</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not a final determination of liability</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not a refund issuance code</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not confirmation of penalties or changes</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">424 &mdash; Examination referral</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">570 &mdash; Additional account action pending</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Notes and edge cases</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Examinations vary in scope and duration. Code 420 alone does not specify whether the examination is correspondence-based or field-based. The timing of related transcript updates can depend on the examination unit handling the case. The presence of code 420 does not automatically result in account changes until review actions are recorded.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Optional next actions</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Review transcript updates for related examination codes</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Monitor official IRS correspondence for details</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Maintain records relevant to the tax period in question</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Consult official IRS resources if clarification is needed</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">External help (optional)</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If an examination code appears and questions arise, official IRS communications or authorized tax professionals can help interpret the transcript and outline standard procedures.</span></p>

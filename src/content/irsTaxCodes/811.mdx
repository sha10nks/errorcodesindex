<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Code 811 reflects that the IRS has removed a freeze previously applied to the refund. It signals that the account is no longer in the specific frozen status associated with earlier transaction entries. This code allows refund processing to continue under normal procedures. It does not guarantee immediate payment, but it indicates that the blocking condition has been cleared. The code represents a system-level release action.</span></p>

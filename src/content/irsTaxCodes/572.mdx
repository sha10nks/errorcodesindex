<p class="c1"><span class="c0">One-sentence summary</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This code indicates that a previously applied refund hold has been lifted.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Code 572 reflects that the IRS has removed a hold that was preventing refund issuance. It typically appears after a freeze or pending action has been resolved. The code indicates that the account is no longer in the specific hold state associated with earlier transaction codes. It does not guarantee immediate refund issuance but signals that the restriction preventing release has been lifted. The presence of 572 often precedes or accompanies refund-related processing updates.</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code is NOT</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not the same as refund issued</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Notes and edge cases</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The timing between 572 and refund issuance can vary. In some cases, multiple holds may exist, and releasing one hold does not remove all restrictions. Transcript entries should be reviewed together to understand overall account status. Cycle dates can provide general timing context but do not confirm payment timing.</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Monitor the transcript for refund issuance entries</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Check official IRS status tools for updates</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If clarification is needed, consult official IRS resources</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">External help (optional)</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If refund release codes appear but payment details remain unclear, official IRS guidance or authorized tax professionals may assist in interpreting the transcript sequence.</span></p>

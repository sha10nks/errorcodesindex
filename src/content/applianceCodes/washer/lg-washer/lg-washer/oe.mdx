<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">OE appears when the appliance detects that water remains in the drum after the drain cycle. The system monitors water level sensors during draining. If levels do not decrease as programmed, the cycle halts. This code signals a drain-time monitoring response. It does not automatically indicate pump damage.</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not a motor fault</span></p>

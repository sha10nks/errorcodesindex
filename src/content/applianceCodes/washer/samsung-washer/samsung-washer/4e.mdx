<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This code indicates that the appliance did not detect adequate water entering during the fill cycle.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">4E appears when the washer&rsquo;s control system determines that the drum is not filling within the expected timeframe. Internal sensors monitor water level changes during the intake stage. If the required level is not reached within programmed limits, the cycle pauses. This code reflects a water intake monitoring condition. It does not automatically confirm valve failure or plumbing damage.</span></p>

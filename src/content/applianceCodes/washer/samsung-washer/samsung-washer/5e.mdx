<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This code indicates that the washer did not drain water within the expected timeframe.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">5E appears when the appliance detects that water remains in the drum beyond the programmed drain duration. The washer monitors water level reduction during the drain cycle. If the level does not decrease sufficiently within defined limits, the system halts the cycle. This code reflects a drain monitoring condition. It does not automatically confirm pump failure.</span></p>

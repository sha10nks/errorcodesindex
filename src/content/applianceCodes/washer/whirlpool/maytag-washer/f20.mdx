<p class="c1"><span class="c0">One-sentence summary</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This code indicates that the washer did not detect sufficient water entering the drum during the fill cycle.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">F20 appears when the control system determines that water flow into the appliance has not reached the expected level within a programmed time window. The washer monitors both fill duration and internal water level signals. If the system does not detect the required increase in water level, it interrupts the cycle. This code reflects a fill-condition monitoring response rather than a confirmed mechanical defect. It does not automatically indicate that a component has permanently failed.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Where users usually see this code</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">At the beginning of a wash cycle</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">During the initial fill stage</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">On the appliance control display</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Why this code usually appears</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fill time exceeds programmed threshold</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Water level sensor does not register expected increase</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Intake monitoring timeout triggered</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What typically happens next</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The cycle pauses</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The drum remains empty or partially filled</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The machine may attempt a brief retry before stopping</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code is NOT</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not a drain system fault</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not a motor malfunction</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not a heating issue</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Notes and edge cases</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Low household water pressure can occasionally trigger this code. Some models attempt multiple fill checks before displaying the error permanently.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Optional next actions</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Confirm that the water supply is active</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Allow the appliance to reset</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Restart the cycle if the code clears</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">External help (optional)</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If the condition repeats consistently, manufacturer-authorized service channels may provide further evaluation.</span></p>

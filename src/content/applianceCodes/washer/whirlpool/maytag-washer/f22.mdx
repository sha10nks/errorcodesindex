<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">F22 appears when the control system cannot confirm that the door has locked properly. The washer requires a secure latch before initiating operation. If the lock confirmation signal is absent or inconsistent, the cycle stops. This code reflects a safety monitoring response. It does not automatically indicate physical damage to the door.</span></p>

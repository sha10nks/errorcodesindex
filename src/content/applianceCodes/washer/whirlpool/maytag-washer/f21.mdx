<p class="c1"><span class="c0">One-sentence summary</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This code indicates that the washer did not complete the drain cycle within the expected time.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">F21 appears when the appliance detects that water remains in the drum beyond the programmed drain duration. The control board monitors water level reduction during draining. If the level does not drop within a defined time window, the system halts progress. This code signals a drain-time monitoring condition. It does not automatically confirm pump failure.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Where users usually see this code</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Toward the end of a wash cycle</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before the spin cycle begins</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">On the control panel display</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Why this code usually appears</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Drain time exceeded threshold</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Water level does not decrease as expected</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Protective timeout activated</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What typically happens next</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Cycle pauses</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Spin function does not initiate</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Water may remain in drum</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code is NOT</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not a fill issue</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not a heating error</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not a door lock problem</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Notes and edge cases</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Heavily loaded cycles may slightly extend drain duration. Some models attempt brief retries before displaying the code.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Optional next actions</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wait to see if the appliance retries</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Restart the cycle after reset</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Observe whether the issue repeats</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">External help (optional)</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Persistent drain timing alerts may require inspection by an authorized technician.</span></p>

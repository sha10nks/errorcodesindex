<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This code indicates that the appliance detected an internal control system irregularity.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">E45 appears when the washer&rsquo;s main control board registers inconsistent internal processing signals. The appliance performs continuous self-checks during operation. If a processing error or communication inconsistency is detected, the cycle halts to prevent unpredictable behavior. This code reflects a protective shutdown triggered by control logic monitoring. It does not automatically confirm complete board failure.</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">E15 appears when moisture sensors detect water in the base compartment of the appliance. Bosch dishwashers include a safety system designed to shut down operation if water is detected outside the sealed wash area. When triggered, the system prevents further filling and may activate the drain pump. This code reflects a protective safety response. It does not automatically confirm major internal damage.</span></p>

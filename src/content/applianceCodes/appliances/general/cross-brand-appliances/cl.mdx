<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">CL appears when the control interface has been intentionally locked to prevent unintended input. Many appliances include a control lock or child lock feature that disables button functions. When activated, the display indicates the locked state. This code reflects a user-interface status rather than a malfunction. The appliance&rsquo;s primary systems typically remain operational if already running.</span></p>

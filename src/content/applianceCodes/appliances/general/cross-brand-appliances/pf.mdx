<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This code indicates that the appliance detected a recent interruption in electrical power.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">PF appears when the appliance registers a loss of incoming power during operation or while in standby mode. Many modern appliances record power interruptions to inform the user that a cycle may have been disrupted. The control system compares voltage stability against expected operating parameters. If a disruption is detected, the code is stored and displayed. This code reflects a monitoring alert rather than an internal mechanical failure.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Where users usually see this code</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code is NOT</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not a control board failure</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not a motor issue</span></p>

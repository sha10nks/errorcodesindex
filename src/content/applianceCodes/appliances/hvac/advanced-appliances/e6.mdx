<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This code indicates that the appliance detected a communication interruption between internal components.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">E6 appears when control modules within the appliance fail to exchange signals as expected. Advanced appliances rely on continuous communication between boards, sensors, and control interfaces. If signal transmission is disrupted or inconsistent, the system records this code and may pause operation. This code reflects internal data communication monitoring. It does not automatically confirm control board failure.</span></p>

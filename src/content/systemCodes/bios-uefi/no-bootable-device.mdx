<p>CODE: NO BOOTABLE DEVICE</p>
<p>Title</p>
<p>(NO BOOTABLE DEVICE &mdash; Boot device missing)</p>
<p>One-sentence summary</p>
<p>Firmware could not find a valid bootable device for the configured boot order.</p>
<p>What this code means</p>
<p>“NO BOOTABLE DEVICE” indicates the firmware could not find a bootable device based on current boot configuration. It can occur if the boot drive is not detected, the boot order is incorrect, or the OS bootloader is not accessible.</p>
<p>Where users usually see this code</p>
<p>During POST at startup</p>
<p>Firmware security checks (TPM/Secure Boot)</p>
<p>Boot device selection and initialization</p>
<p>Hardware monitoring screens</p>
<p>Why this code usually appears</p>
<p>A required component did not initialize correctly</p>
<p>Boot configuration could not find a valid device</p>
<p>Security policy blocked boot</p>
<p>Firmware detected a health or configuration issue</p>
<p>What typically happens next</p>
<p>Boot may stop or loop at startup</p>
<p>A firmware message is displayed</p>
<p>The system may enter recovery or setup screens</p>
<p>What this code is NOT</p>
<p>It is not safe to guess at hardware fixes</p>
<p>It is not always solved by a firmware update</p>
<p>Troubleshooting checklist</p>
<p>Record the exact message and the device model</p>
<p>Check official documentation for the specific OEM mapping</p>
<p>Confirm boot order and whether the expected drive is detected</p>
<p>Verify date/time settings if security validation is failing</p>
<p>Avoid hardware disassembly unless qualified and instructed</p>
<p>Use vendor support pathways for repeat boot failures</p>
<p>Related error codes</p>
<p>CMOS CHECKSUM BAD — Firmware settings invalid</p>
<p>CMOS BATTERY FAILURE — RTC/CMOS battery issue</p>
<p>SMART STATUS BAD — Drive health warning</p>
<p>PXE-E61: MEDIA TEST FAILURE — Network boot attempted</p>
<p>Notes and edge cases</p>
<p>Firmware messages and beep codes vary significantly by vendor and model.</p>

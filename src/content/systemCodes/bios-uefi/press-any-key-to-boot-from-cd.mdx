<p>One-sentence summary</p>
<p>The system detected bootable external media and is asking whether to boot from it.</p>
<p>What this code means</p>
<p>This prompt is not an error by itself. It indicates the firmware detected bootable media (USB/DVD) and is giving you a chance to boot from it instead of the internal drive.</p>
<p>Where users usually see this code</p>
<p>When a bootable USB/DVD is inserted</p>
<p>During OS installation or recovery</p>
<p>Why this code usually appears</p>
<p>Boot order prioritizes removable media</p>
<p>User selected a temporary boot device</p>
<p>What typically happens next</p>
<p>Pressing a key boots from the external media; not pressing continues normal boot</p>
<p>What this code is NOT</p>
<p>It is not a failure message</p>
<p>It is not a disk corruption indicator</p>
<p>Troubleshooting checklist</p>
<p>If you did not intend to boot from external media, remove the USB/DVD and reboot</p>
<p>Adjust boot order if the prompt appears unexpectedly</p>

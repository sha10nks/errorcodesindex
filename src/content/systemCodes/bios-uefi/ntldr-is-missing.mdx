<p>(NTLDR IS MISSING &mdash; Legacy boot loader missing)</p>
<p>One-sentence summary</p>
<p>The system is attempting a legacy boot but cannot find the required loader on the boot device.</p>
<p>What this code means</p>
<p>“NTLDR is missing” is a legacy boot error indicating the system is trying to boot using older BIOS/MBR boot logic, but the expected loader file is missing or unreadable. It is often associated with boot order issues, incorrect boot mode, or boot file corruption.</p>
<p>Where users usually see this code</p>
<p>Older systems or legacy boot configurations</p>
<p>After changing boot mode (UEFI/Legacy) or moving drives</p>
<p>Why this code usually appears</p>
<p>Boot order points to the wrong device</p>
<p>Legacy boot mode is enabled for a UEFI-installed OS</p>
<p>Boot sector/loader files are corrupted or missing</p>
<p>What typically happens next</p>
<p>The machine stops booting and prompts for action</p>
<p>What this code is NOT</p>
<p>It is not a Windows Update error</p>
<p>It is not a password issue</p>
<p>Troubleshooting checklist</p>
<p>Verify boot mode (UEFI vs Legacy) matches how the OS was installed</p>
<p>Adjust boot order to the correct system disk</p>
<p>Use official recovery media to repair boot configuration when needed</p>

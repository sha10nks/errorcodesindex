<p>CODE: CMOS BATTERY FAILURE</p>
<p>Title</p>
<p>(CMOS BATTERY FAILURE &mdash; RTC/CMOS battery issue)</p>
<p>One-sentence summary</p>
<p>Firmware reported that the battery maintaining time/settings is not functioning correctly.</p>
<p>What this code means</p>
<p>“CMOS BATTERY FAILURE” indicates the firmware detected an issue with the battery used to maintain time and configuration settings. It can lead to time resets and configuration loss, affecting boot and security validation.</p>
<p>Where users usually see this code</p>
<p>During POST at startup</p>
<p>Firmware security checks (TPM/Secure Boot)</p>
<p>Boot device selection and initialization</p>
<p>Hardware monitoring screens</p>
<p>Why this code usually appears</p>
<p>A required component did not initialize correctly</p>
<p>Boot configuration could not find a valid device</p>
<p>Security policy blocked boot</p>
<p>Firmware detected a health or configuration issue</p>
<p>What typically happens next</p>
<p>Boot may stop or loop at startup</p>
<p>A firmware message is displayed</p>
<p>The system may enter recovery or setup screens</p>
<p>What this code is NOT</p>
<p>It is not safe to guess at hardware fixes</p>
<p>It is not always solved by a firmware update</p>
<p>Troubleshooting checklist</p>
<p>Record the exact message and the device model</p>
<p>Check official documentation for the specific OEM mapping</p>
<p>Confirm boot order and whether the expected drive is detected</p>
<p>Verify date/time settings if security validation is failing</p>
<p>Avoid hardware disassembly unless qualified and instructed</p>
<p>Use vendor support pathways for repeat boot failures</p>
<p>Related error codes</p>
<p>CMOS CHECKSUM BAD — Firmware settings invalid</p>
<p>NO BOOTABLE DEVICE — Boot device missing</p>
<p>SMART STATUS BAD — Drive health warning</p>
<p>PXE-E61: MEDIA TEST FAILURE — Network boot attempted</p>
<p>Notes and edge cases</p>
<p>Firmware messages and beep codes vary significantly by vendor and model.</p>

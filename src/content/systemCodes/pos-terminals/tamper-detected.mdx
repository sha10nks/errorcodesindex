<p>(TAMPER &mdash; Tamper detected)</p>
<p>One-sentence summary</p>
<p>The terminal detected a tamper condition and disabled sensitive functions to protect encryption keys.</p>
<p>What this code means</p>
<p>“Tamper” messages on payment terminals indicate the device’s tamper-detection mechanisms triggered. Terminals are designed to protect cardholder data and encryption keys; when tamper is detected, the terminal may lock down and require certified service or key reload procedures.</p>
<p>Where users usually see this code</p>
<p>Terminal boot screens</p>
<p>After drops, impacts, or casing/connector stress</p>
<p>After extreme temperature/humidity exposure</p>
<p>Why this code usually appears</p>
<p>Physical tamper sensor triggered</p>
<p>Battery-backed security module state issue</p>
<p>Hardware fault interpreted as tamper</p>
<p>What typically happens next</p>
<p>The terminal disables payment acceptance</p>
<p>Replacement or certified servicing is required</p>
<p>What this code is NOT</p>
<p>It is not a customer card decline</p>
<p>It is not fixable by reinstalling an app</p>
<p>Troubleshooting checklist</p>
<p>Do not attempt to open the terminal casing</p>
<p>Remove the terminal from service and contact your processor/vendor</p>
<p>Follow certified replacement/service procedures to maintain compliance</p>

<p>KEYS NOT LOADED — Terminal key state issue</p>
<p>UPDATE REQUIRED — Software version required</p>
<p>Notes and edge cases</p>
<p>Tamper handling is compliance-sensitive; use official support channels rather than guesswork.</p>

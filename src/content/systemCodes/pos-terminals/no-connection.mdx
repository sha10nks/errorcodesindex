<p>One-sentence summary</p>
<p>The terminal cannot reach the payment host/gateway to authorize the transaction.</p>
<p>What this code means</p>

<p>Internet outage or unstable Wi-Fi/Ethernet</p>
<p>Firewall blocks outbound host connections</p>
<p>Processor outage</p>
<p>What typically happens next</p>
<p>Transactions cannot be authorized until connectivity is restored</p>
<p>What this code is NOT</p>
<p>It is not a card decline by the issuer</p>
<p>It is not a terminal tamper event</p>
<p>Troubleshooting checklist</p>
<p>Verify the terminal has network access</p>
<p>Reboot the router or switch and retry</p>
<p>Test with a different network (e.g., backup connection) if available</p>

<p>Title</p>
<p>(ICC READ &mdash; Chip read error)</p>
<p>One-sentence summary</p>
<p>The terminal could not read the EMV chip data from the card.</p>
<p>What this code means</p>
<p>Chip read errors occur when the terminal cannot reliably read EMV (ICC) data from the card. This can be caused by a damaged chip, dirty contacts, or a worn reader.</p>
<p>Where users usually see this code</p>
<p>During chip insert transactions</p>
<p>Older terminals with worn chip slots</p>
<p>Why this code usually appears</p>
<p>Card chip is damaged or contaminated</p>
<p>Terminal chip reader is worn or dirty</p>
<p>Card is removed too early</p>
<p>What typically happens next</p>
<p>Terminal prompts to retry insert or use fallback/payment alternative</p>
<p>What this code is NOT</p>
<p>It is not automatically an issuer decline</p>
<p>It is not an internet outage</p>
<p>Troubleshooting checklist</p>
<p>Retry with a steady insert and keep the card inserted</p>
<p>Clean the reader per vendor guidelines</p>
<p>Try contactless/tap if supported</p>
<p>Related error codes</p>
<p>EMV FALLBACK — Chip fallback</p>
<p>SWIPE READ — Swipe read error</p>
<p>Notes and edge cases</p>
<p>Repeated chip read failures across many cards often indicates a terminal hardware issue.</p>

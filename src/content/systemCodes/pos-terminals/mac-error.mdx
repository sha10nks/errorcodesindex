<p>Title</p>
<p>(MAC ERROR &mdash; Message authentication error)</p>
<p>One-sentence summary</p>
<p>The terminal or host detected a message authentication (MAC) validation failure.</p>
<p>What this code means</p>
<p>MAC errors in payment environments indicate that a cryptographic message authentication check failed. This can occur when terminal keys are not synchronized with the host, when a message was corrupted in transit, or when security configuration is inconsistent.</p>
<p>Where users usually see this code</p>
<p>During secure transactions requiring MAC validation</p>
<p>After key injection or key rotation events</p>
<p>Why this code usually appears</p>
<p>Terminal keys are missing, expired, or incorrect</p>
<p>Host and terminal key sets are out of sync</p>
<p>Communication corruption or protocol mismatch</p>
<p>What typically happens next</p>
<p>Transaction fails and terminal may require key reload</p>
<p>What this code is NOT</p>
<p>It is not a customer card decline reason</p>
<p>It is not safe to attempt security repairs without vendor guidance</p>
<p>Troubleshooting checklist</p>
<p>Confirm terminal keys are loaded and current</p>
<p>Contact processor/vendor for key reload procedures</p>
<p>Related error codes</p>
<p>KEYS NOT LOADED — Terminal key state issue</p>
<p>HOST UNAVAILABLE — Host connection issue</p>
<p>Notes and edge cases</p>
<p>Key handling is compliance-sensitive; follow certified procedures provided by your processor/vendor.</p>

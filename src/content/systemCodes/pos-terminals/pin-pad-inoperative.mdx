<p>Title</p>
<p>(PIN PAD &mdash; PIN pad inoperative)</p>
<p>One-sentence summary</p>
<p>The PIN entry device is not available or not responding, so PIN-based transactions cannot proceed.</p>
<p>What this code means</p>
<p>“PIN pad inoperative” indicates the terminal cannot use the PIN entry device (integrated or external). This prevents debit PIN or PIN-verified transactions until the device is restored or the terminal is serviced.</p>
<p>Where users usually see this code</p>
<p>During debit PIN entry prompts</p>
<p>At terminal startup if peripherals are missing</p>
<p>Why this code usually appears</p>
<p>Loose/failed PIN pad connection</p>
<p>Peripheral driver/module failure</p>
<p>Device is in a locked state after an update</p>
<p>What typically happens next</p>
<p>Terminal may fall back to signature or decline PIN-required transactions</p>
<p>What this code is NOT</p>
<p>It is not a card issuer decline</p>
<p>It is not a batch/settlement error</p>
<p>Troubleshooting checklist</p>
<p>Power-cycle the terminal and reseat cables if external peripherals are used</p>
<p>Verify the terminal is on the supported software version</p>
<p>Contact the terminal vendor if the device remains unavailable</p>

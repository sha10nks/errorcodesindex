<p>Title</p>
<p>(DUPLICATE &mdash; Duplicate transaction)</p>
<p>One-sentence summary</p>
<p>The terminal/processor detected a potential duplicate transaction and blocked it to prevent double-charging.</p>
<p>What this code means</p>
<p>Duplicate transaction messages occur when the processor or terminal detects a repeated authorization attempt that matches a recent transaction (same amount/card/merchant/time window). This is intended to prevent accidental double charges.</p>
<p>Where users usually see this code</p>
<p>Immediately retrying after a timeout</p>
<p>Cashier resubmits the same sale</p>
<p>Why this code usually appears</p>
<p>Previous transaction outcome was not confirmed</p>
<p>Duplicate prevention window is active</p>
<p>What typically happens next</p>
<p>Terminal blocks the second attempt</p>
<p>Merchant should verify the first transaction’s final status</p>
<p>What this code is NOT</p>
<p>It is not proof the customer was charged twice</p>
<p>It is not a “declined” card status</p>
<p>Troubleshooting checklist</p>
<p>Check terminal history/batch to confirm whether the original transaction completed</p>
<p>If the status is unknown, contact the processor before retrying</p>
<p>Related error codes</p>
<p>REVERSAL — Reversal required</p>
<p>TIMEOUT — Transaction timeout</p>
<p>Notes and edge cases</p>
<p>Duplicate detection rules vary by processor; some allow override only through support.</p>

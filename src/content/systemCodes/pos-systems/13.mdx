<p>Title</p>
<p>(13 &mdash; Invalid amount)</p>
<p>One-sentence summary</p>
<p>The transaction amount was not accepted by the processor or issuer.</p>
<p>What this code means</p>
<p>Response code 13 (“Invalid amount”) is commonly used when the transaction amount is formatted incorrectly or not acceptable for the requested operation. It can also occur when currency, limits, or amount validation rules reject the request.</p>
<p>Where users usually see this code</p>
<p>Checkout and payment attempts</p>
<p>Settlement and batch close workflows</p>
<p>Device pairing or peripheral setup</p>
<p>POS sync and configuration screens</p>
<p>Why this code usually appears</p>
<p>A payment decision was returned by issuer/processor</p>
<p>Connectivity or configuration prevented completing the transaction</p>
<p>A device or service dependency was unavailable</p>
<p>What typically happens next</p>
<p>The POS shows an error or decline message</p>
<p>The transaction is not completed as requested</p>
<p>The system may allow retry after the underlying issue is resolved</p>
<p>What this code is NOT</p>
<p>It is not a guarantee of fraud</p>
<p>It is not always a hardware failure</p>
<p>Troubleshooting checklist</p>
<p>Confirm whether the message is a decline or a technical error</p>
<p>Avoid repeated retries if you are unsure whether a charge succeeded</p>
<p>Verify internet connectivity and service status</p>
<p>Check the processor record for the authoritative final state</p>
<p>Confirm terminal and POS configuration (TID/MID, pairing)</p>
<p>Escalate to vendor/processor support for repeated failures</p>
<p>Related error codes</p>
<p>05 — Do not honor</p>
<p>12 — Invalid transaction</p>
<p>14 — Invalid card number</p>
<p>51 — Insufficient funds</p>
<p>Notes and edge cases</p>
<p>POS workflows span multiple layers; the same message can surface from different causes.</p>

<p>Title</p>
<p>(03 &mdash; Invalid merchant)</p>
<p>One-sentence summary</p>
<p>The merchant identifier or acquiring setup is not recognized or not permitted for this transaction.</p>
<p>What this code means</p>
<p>Response code 03 indicates that the merchant or terminal configuration is not valid for the request. This can be caused by incorrect merchant IDs, misconfigured acquiring settings, or routing issues between the terminal/gateway and processor.</p>
<p>Where users usually see this code</p>
<p>New terminal deployments and first transactions</p>
<p>After processor or gateway configuration changes</p>
<p>Merchant account migrations</p>
<p>Why this code usually appears</p>
<p>Merchant ID is incorrect or inactive</p>
<p>Terminal ID is not registered with the acquirer</p>
<p>Processor routing configuration is incomplete</p>
<p>What typically happens next</p>
<p>Transactions are declined until configuration is corrected</p>
<p>Merchant or processor support intervention is usually required</p>
<p>What this code is NOT</p>
<p>It is not a customer card problem</p>
<p>It is not a network timeout code</p>
<p>Troubleshooting checklist</p>
<p>Verify merchant ID, terminal ID, and store number configuration</p>
<p>Confirm the terminal is boarded/enabled with the processor</p>
<p>Check gateway routing and processor credentials</p>
<p>Contact the processor/acquirer if configuration cannot be verified locally</p>
<p>Related error codes</p>
<p>12 — Invalid transaction</p>
<p>14 — Invalid card number</p>
<p>58 — Transaction not permitted to terminal</p>
<p>Notes and edge cases</p>
<p>Some processors use 03 for “invalid merchant” and other onboarding errors; consult the processor’s response mapping.</p>

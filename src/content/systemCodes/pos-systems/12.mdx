<p>Title</p>
<p>(12 &mdash; Invalid transaction)</p>
<p>One-sentence summary</p>
<p>The transaction type or requested operation was not accepted for processing.</p>
<p>What this code means</p>
<p>Response code 12 (“Invalid transaction”) is commonly used when the requested transaction type is not valid for the account, terminal, or processing context. It often indicates a mismatch between the transaction request and what the network or issuer expects.</p>
<p>Where users usually see this code</p>
<p>Checkout and payment attempts</p>
<p>Settlement and batch close workflows</p>
<p>Device pairing or peripheral setup</p>
<p>POS sync and configuration screens</p>
<p>Why this code usually appears</p>
<p>A payment decision was returned by issuer/processor</p>
<p>Connectivity or configuration prevented completing the transaction</p>
<p>A device or service dependency was unavailable</p>
<p>What typically happens next</p>
<p>The POS shows an error or decline message</p>
<p>The transaction is not completed as requested</p>
<p>The system may allow retry after the underlying issue is resolved</p>
<p>What this code is NOT</p>
<p>It is not a guarantee of fraud</p>
<p>It is not always a hardware failure</p>
<p>Troubleshooting checklist</p>
<p>Confirm whether the message is a decline or a technical error</p>
<p>Avoid repeated retries if you are unsure whether a charge succeeded</p>
<p>Verify internet connectivity and service status</p>
<p>Check the processor record for the authoritative final state</p>
<p>Confirm terminal and POS configuration (TID/MID, pairing)</p>
<p>Escalate to vendor/processor support for repeated failures</p>
<p>Related error codes</p>
<p>05 — Do not honor</p>
<p>13 — Invalid amount</p>
<p>14 — Invalid card number</p>
<p>51 — Insufficient funds</p>
<p>Notes and edge cases</p>
<p>POS workflows span multiple layers; the same message can surface from different causes.</p>

<p>Title</p>
<p>(06 &mdash; Error)</p>
<p>One-sentence summary</p>
<p>A generic issuer or network error occurred; the transaction could not be processed as submitted.</p>
<p>What this code means</p>
<p>Response code 06 is a generic error response used by some issuers/networks when they cannot process the authorization normally. It does not pinpoint a specific decline reason and may be transient.</p>
<p>Where users usually see this code</p>
<p>Intermittent processing failures at the terminal</p>
<p>Processor logs during network instability</p>
<p>Why this code usually appears</p>
<p>Issuer processing error</p>
<p>Network or switch issue during authorization routing</p>
<p>Malformed or incomplete request data</p>
<p>What typically happens next</p>
<p>The transaction declines and may succeed on retry</p>
<p>Some terminals prompt to retry or use another method</p>
<p>What this code is NOT</p>
<p>It is not a definitive “insufficient funds” code</p>
<p>It is not always a card status issue</p>
<p>Troubleshooting checklist</p>
<p>Retry once after confirming network connectivity</p>
<p>If repeated, try a different card or payment method</p>
<p>Check processor/gateway logs for additional diagnostic text</p>
<p>Contact processor support if errors cluster across many transactions</p>
<p>Related error codes</p>
<p>91 — Issuer or switch inoperative</p>
<p>96 — System malfunction</p>
<p>12 — Invalid transaction</p>
<p>Notes and edge cases</p>
<p>Some processors map 06 to a generic decline; the more specific reason may appear in extended response fields.</p>

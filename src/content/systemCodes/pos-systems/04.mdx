<p>Title</p>
<p>(04 &mdash; Pick up card)</p>
<p>One-sentence summary</p>
<p>The issuer indicates the card should be retained and the transaction should not proceed.</p>
<p>What this code means</p>
<p>Response code 04 is an issuer instruction that the card should be picked up/retained (where permitted) and the transaction declined. Modern POS environments often cannot retain cards; in practice, it is treated as a hard decline requiring the cardholder to contact their bank.</p>
<p>Where users usually see this code</p>
<p>High-risk authorizations</p>
<p>Card status issues reported by the issuer</p>
<p>Why this code usually appears</p>
<p>Issuer flagged the card status (lost/stolen/suspected compromise)</p>
<p>Issuer risk rules triggered a retain instruction</p>
<p>What typically happens next</p>
<p>The transaction is declined</p>
<p>Merchant is instructed to request another payment method</p>
<p>What this code is NOT</p>
<p>It is not a terminal configuration problem</p>
<p>It is not a connectivity issue</p>
<p>Troubleshooting checklist</p>
<p>Do not retry the same authorization repeatedly</p>
<p>Ask the cardholder to contact the issuer and use another payment method</p>
<p>Follow processor/acquirer guidance for card-retain instructions (policies vary)</p>
<p>Related error codes</p>
<p>41 — Lost card</p>
<p>43 — Stolen card</p>
<p>05 — Do not honor</p>
<p>Notes and edge cases</p>
<p>Handling of “retain card” responses is governed by merchant and acquirer policies; do not put staff at risk.</p>

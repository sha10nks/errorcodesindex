<p>One-sentence summary</p>
<p>The card issuer could not be identified or the routing information was not recognized.</p>
<p>What this code means</p>
<p>Response code 15 indicates the authorization request could not be routed to a valid issuer. This can happen when the issuer identification data is not recognized, when the card number is invalid, or when the acquiring/processor routing tables do not recognize the issuer.</p>

<p>What typically happens next</p>
<p>The transaction is declined</p>
<p>Merchant may need to use a different acquirer or enable additional card networks</p>
<p>What this code is NOT</p>
<p>It is not an insufficient funds decline</p>
<p>It is not a POS device malfunction code</p>
<p>Troubleshooting checklist</p>
<p>Re-check card entry method and number</p>
<p>Try chip/tap instead of manual entry where possible</p>
<p>Confirm the merchant account supports the card network/type</p>
<p>Escalate to processor support if the card is valid but routing fails</p>

<p>Title</p>
<p>(0xC0000072 &mdash; Account disabled)</p>
<p>One-sentence summary</p>
<p>Authentication failed because the account is disabled.</p>
<p>What this code means</p>
<p>0xC0000072 is commonly associated with an account disabled state. The system refused authentication because the account is not enabled for login under current policy.</p>
<p>Where users usually see this code</p>
<p>Login and authentication prompts</p>
<p>Privilege elevation or policy checks</p>
<p>Certificate or token validation failures</p>
<p>Security product or OS enforcement dialogs</p>
<p>Why this code usually appears</p>
<p>Credentials, tokens, or policies did not validate</p>
<p>An account state (locked/disabled/expired) prevented access</p>
<p>Time/certificate validation failed</p>
<p>A security control blocked the requested operation</p>
<p>What typically happens next</p>
<p>Access is denied and the operation stops</p>
<p>An audit log entry is created</p>
<p>A retry may succeed after policy/account issues are resolved</p>
<p>What this code is NOT</p>
<p>It is not safe to bypass security controls to test</p>
<p>It is not always a network outage</p>
<p>Troubleshooting checklist</p>
<p>Confirm the exact code and the context where it appears</p>
<p>Verify time and time zone for certificate-based authentication</p>
<p>Check account status (locked, disabled, expired) if applicable</p>
<p>Review the relevant audit logs for the real reason</p>
<p>Avoid disabling security products as a troubleshooting step</p>
<p>Use official admin and vendor remediation procedures</p>
<p>Related error codes</p>

<p>0xC000006A — Wrong password</p>
<p>0xC0000234 — Account locked out</p>

<p>Notes and edge cases</p>
<p>Security systems may intentionally hide detail; logs are typically the authoritative explanation.</p>

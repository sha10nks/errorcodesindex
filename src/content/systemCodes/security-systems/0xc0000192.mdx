<p>(0xC0000192 &mdash; Account restriction)</p>
<p>One-sentence summary</p>
<p>Authentication failed due to an account restriction rather than incorrect credentials.</p>
<p>What this code means</p>
<p>0xC0000192 is a Windows authentication status used when account restriction policies prevent login. This can include restrictions like logon type constraints, workstation restrictions, or other policy blocks depending on configuration.</p>
<p>Where users usually see this code</p>
<p>Windows Security event logs</p>
<p>Service and remote access authentication attempts</p>
<p>Why this code usually appears</p>
<p>Account policy restrictions in place</p>
<p>Group policy changes affecting user rights</p>
<p>What typically happens next</p>
<p>Login fails until policy allows the action</p>
<p>What this code is NOT</p>
<p>It is not necessarily a disabled account</p>
<p>It is not always a wrong password</p>
<p>Troubleshooting checklist</p>
<p>Review account restrictions and group policy settings</p>
<p>Confirm the logon type and source host</p>
<p>Related error codes</p>
<p>0xC000015B — Logon type not granted</p>
<p>0xC000006F — Invalid logon hours</p>
<p>0xC0000070 — Invalid workstation</p>
<p>Notes and edge cases</p>
<p>Security monitoring should treat restriction codes differently than brute-force password failures.</p>

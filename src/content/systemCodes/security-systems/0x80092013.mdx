<p>Title</p>
<p>(0x80092013 &mdash; Certificate revocation check failed)</p>
<p>One-sentence summary</p>
<p>Windows could not complete certificate revocation checking, often because the revocation server could not be reached.</p>
<p>What this code means</p>
<p>0x80092013 indicates a failure during certificate revocation checking. When validating certificates, Windows may attempt to check CRL/OCSP endpoints to confirm the certificate has not been revoked. If those endpoints are unreachable or blocked, validation can fail.</p>
<p>Where users usually see this code</p>
<p>TLS/SSL connections from Windows components</p>
<p>Code signing and installer validation</p>
<p>Smart card and certificate enrollment flows</p>
<p>Why this code usually appears</p>
<p>CRL/OCSP endpoints are blocked by firewall/proxy</p>
<p>Network restrictions prevent outbound access</p>
<p>Certificate chain contains unreachable revocation URLs</p>
<p>What typically happens next</p>
<p>The secure operation fails until revocation checking can complete</p>
<p>What this code is NOT</p>
<p>It is not a “wrong password” login error</p>
<p>It is not always a bad certificate</p>
<p>Troubleshooting checklist</p>
<p>Verify system time/date</p>
<p>Confirm the network allows access to revocation endpoints required by the certificate chain</p>
<p>In managed environments, coordinate proxy/firewall allowances with IT</p>
<p>Related error codes</p>
<p>0x800B0109 — Certificate chain not trusted</p>
<p>0x80072f8f — Secure channel error</p>
<p>Notes and edge cases</p>
<p>Security policies vary; some environments enforce revocation checks strictly and require outbound access for validation.</p>

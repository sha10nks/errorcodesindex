<p>Title</p>
<p>(0xC0000071 &mdash; Password expired)</p>
<p>One-sentence summary</p>
<p>The account password has expired and must be changed before login can succeed.</p>
<p>What this code means</p>

<p>Domain logon failures for users with expired passwords</p>
<p>Service accounts that were not rotated</p>

<p>Account not rotated/managed for long periods</p>
<p>What typically happens next</p>
<p>Login fails; user must change password</p>
<p>Automations using that account fail until updated</p>
<p>What this code is NOT</p>
<p>It is not an account lockout (that is a different condition)</p>
<p>It is not necessarily a wrong password attempt</p>
<p>Troubleshooting checklist</p>
<p>Change the password through approved channels</p>
<p>Update stored credentials for services/scheduled tasks</p>

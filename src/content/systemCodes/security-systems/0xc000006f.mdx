<p>The user is not permitted to log on at this time based on account restrictions.</p>

<p>Time zone mismatch in policy expectation</p>
<p>What typically happens next</p>
<p>Logon is denied until within permitted hours or policy is changed</p>
<p>What this code is NOT</p>
<p>It is not necessarily a wrong password</p>

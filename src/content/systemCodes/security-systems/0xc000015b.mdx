<p>CODE: 0xC000015B</p>
<p>Title</p>
<p>(0xC000015B &mdash; Logon type not granted)</p>
<p>One-sentence summary</p>
<p>The account is not allowed to log on using the requested logon type (e.g., RDP, service, network).</p>
<p>What this code means</p>
<p>0xC000015B indicates a policy restriction that denies the requested logon type. For example, an account may be blocked from interactive logon, remote desktop logon, or “log on as a service” depending on local or domain policy.</p>
<p>Where users usually see this code</p>
<p>RDP login failures</p>
<p>Service startup failures when the service account lacks “log on as a service”</p>
<p>Why this code usually appears</p>
<p>User rights assignment policy does not permit that logon type</p>
<p>Group policy changed</p>
<p>Account moved to different group/OU</p>
<p>What typically happens next</p>
<p>Authentication fails until rights are granted appropriately</p>
<p>What this code is NOT</p>
<p>It is not always a wrong password</p>
<p>It is not a network outage</p>
<p>Troubleshooting checklist</p>
<p>Identify the logon type (service, RDP, network) being attempted</p>
<p>Review user rights assignment and group policy</p>
<p>Grant the minimal required rights following your security policy</p>
<p>Related error codes</p>
<p>0xC000006F — Invalid logon hours</p>
<p>0xC0000070 — Invalid workstation</p>
<p>Notes and edge cases</p>
<p>Over-granting logon rights is a security risk; apply least privilege.</p>

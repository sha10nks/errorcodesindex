<p>Title</p>
<p>(0xC0000224 &mdash; Password must change)</p>
<p>One-sentence summary</p>
<p>The account requires the password to be changed before it can be used to log on.</p>
<p>What this code means</p>
<p>0xC0000224 indicates the account is in a “must change password” state, such as after an admin reset or first login requirement. Authentication will not complete until the password is changed through an allowed flow.</p>
<p>Where users usually see this code</p>
<p>First login after password reset</p>
<p>Service accounts accidentally configured to require password change</p>
<p>Why this code usually appears</p>
<p>Admin set “User must change password at next logon”</p>
<p>Account provisioning workflows</p>
<p>What typically happens next</p>
<p>Login fails until password is changed</p>
<p>What this code is NOT</p>
<p>It is not an account lockout</p>
<p>It is not an incorrect password indicator</p>
<p>Troubleshooting checklist</p>
<p>Change the password using an approved method (interactive logon or password change tools)</p>
<p>For service accounts, remove “must change password” and set proper rotation controls</p>
<p>Related error codes</p>
<p>0xC0000071 — Password expired</p>
<p>0xC000006A — Wrong password</p>
<p>Notes and edge cases</p>
<p>Service accounts cannot usually complete interactive password change flows; configuration must match usage.</p>

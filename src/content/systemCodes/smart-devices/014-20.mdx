<p>(014.20 &mdash; Weak Wi‑Fi signal)</p>
<p>One-sentence summary</p>
<p>A Roku device indicates the wireless signal strength is insufficient for reliable connectivity.</p>
<p>What this code means</p>
<p>Roku 014.xx connectivity variants can indicate Wi‑Fi quality issues. 014.20 is commonly associated with needing better Wi‑Fi signal strength or more stable wireless conditions.</p>
<p>Where users usually see this code</p>
<p>When the device is far from the router</p>
<p>When walls/interference reduce signal quality</p>
<p>Why this code usually appears</p>
<p>Weak signal or interference</p>
<p>Router placement and channel congestion</p>
<p>What typically happens next</p>
<p>Streaming may fail or be unstable until signal improves</p>
<p>What this code is NOT</p>
<p>It is not a billing/account issue</p>
<p>It is not a TV display error</p>
<p>Troubleshooting checklist</p>
<p>Move the device or router closer</p>
<p>Use a less congested Wi‑Fi channel</p>
<p>Consider Ethernet if available</p>
<p>Related error codes</p>
<p>017 — Poor wireless signal</p>
<p>018 — Slow internet speeds</p>
<p>Notes and edge cases</p>
<p>Wi‑Fi signal strength and internet speed are different; improving signal doesn’t always fix ISP-side issues.</p>

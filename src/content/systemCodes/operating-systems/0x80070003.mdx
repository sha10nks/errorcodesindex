<p>Title</p>
<p>(0x80070003 &mdash; Path not found)</p>
<p>One-sentence summary</p>
<p>A required directory or path was missing or not reachable.</p>
<p>What this code means</p>
<p>0x80070003 commonly indicates that a required path was not found. The directory or location referenced by the operation does not exist, is not mounted, or is not reachable under the current context. It is frequently seen in installer and update workflows.</p>
<p>Where users usually see this code</p>
<p>OS update or installer workflows</p>
<p>System dialogs or setup screens</p>
<p>Application install, launch, or repair operations</p>
<p>Built-in troubleshooting tools and logs</p>
<p>Why this code usually appears</p>
<p>The OS blocked an operation due to missing requirements</p>
<p>A file, component, or dependency was missing or corrupted</p>
<p>A path, permission, or configuration check failed</p>
<p>A required service or network step did not complete</p>
<p>What typically happens next</p>
<p>The operation fails or rolls back</p>
<p>A log entry is recorded</p>
<p>The system remains usable but the task does not complete</p>
<p>What this code is NOT</p>
<p>It is not automatically a hardware failure</p>
<p>It is not proof of account enforcement by a third-party service</p>
<p>Troubleshooting checklist</p>
<p>Retry after a restart to clear transient locks</p>
<p>Confirm free disk space and basic system health</p>
<p>Verify time and time zone for certificate-based operations</p>
<p>Check the closest relevant log source for more detail</p>
<p>Avoid deleting system files; use built-in repair tools instead</p>
<p>If the code persists after safe checks, use official support paths</p>
<p>Related error codes</p>
<p>0x80070005 — Access denied</p>

<p>0x80070057 — Parameter incorrect</p>
<p>Notes and edge cases</p>
<p>The same code can appear in multiple contexts; the surrounding message and log source matter.</p>

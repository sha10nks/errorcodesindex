<p>Title</p>
<p>(0x80072EFD &mdash; Cannot connect)</p>
<p>One-sentence summary</p>
<p>Windows could not establish a connection to the required service endpoint.</p>
<p>What this code means</p>
<p>0x80072EFD indicates a connection failure when Windows attempts to reach an online service (commonly update or store services). It can occur when networking is blocked, misconfigured, or when required endpoints are unreachable.</p>
<p>Where users usually see this code</p>
<p>Windows Update operations</p>
<p>Microsoft Store app installs/updates</p>
<p>Activation or sign-in that needs service communication</p>
<p>Update and networking logs</p>
<p>Why this code usually appears</p>
<p>Proxy/firewall restrictions</p>
<p>DNS issues or captive portals</p>
<p>Incorrect time/time zone impacting TLS connections</p>
<p>Service outage or connectivity interruption</p>
<p>What typically happens next</p>
<p>Requests fail until connectivity is restored</p>
<p>Retries may succeed if the issue was transient</p>
<p>What this code is NOT</p>
<p>It is not an installer corruption code by itself</p>
<p>It does not indicate which endpoint was blocked without logs</p>
<p>Troubleshooting checklist</p>
<p>Verify internet access and rule out captive portals</p>
<p>Confirm system date/time are correct</p>
<p>Check proxy settings and disable unnecessary proxies for testing</p>
<p>Test on a different network to isolate local restrictions</p>
<p>Use official Microsoft troubleshooting guidance if the issue persists</p>

<p>Title</p>
<p>(0xC1900101 &mdash; Rollback due to driver issue)</p>
<p>One-sentence summary</p>
<p>A Windows upgrade failed and rolled back, commonly when a driver causes a compatibility or stability problem.</p>
<p>What this code means</p>
<p>0xC1900101 is widely associated with Windows upgrade failures that are often driver-related. During feature upgrades, Windows performs compatibility checks and staged migrations; if a driver crashes, fails to migrate, or blocks a step, Windows may roll back to the previous version.</p>
<p>Where users usually see this code</p>
<p>Windows feature update attempts</p>
<p>Setup rollback screens</p>
<p>SetupDiag or upgrade logs</p>
<p>Why this code usually appears</p>
<p>An incompatible or outdated device driver</p>
<p>Third-party security software interfering with setup</p>
<p>Connected peripherals triggering driver installs during upgrade</p>
<p>Insufficient resources or errors during the migration phase</p>
<p>What typically happens next</p>
<p>Windows reverts to the previous version</p>
<p>The device remains usable but un-upgraded</p>
<p>What this code is NOT</p>
<p>It is not always a single driver’s fault without log confirmation</p>
<p>It does not imply data loss occurred</p>
<p>Troubleshooting checklist</p>
<p>Disconnect non-essential peripherals and retry</p>
<p>Update critical drivers (storage, chipset, network) from the OEM</p>
<p>Temporarily remove or disable third-party security tools for testing (re-enable after)</p>
<p>Ensure adequate free disk space before the upgrade</p>
<p>Use official upgrade logs/diagnostics to identify the failing component</p>

<p>Notes and edge cases</p>
<p>Driver-related upgrade failures are common on older hardware and on systems with vendor-specific utilities.</p>

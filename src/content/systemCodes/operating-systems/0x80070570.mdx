<p>Title</p>
<p>(0x80070570 &mdash; File is corrupted)</p>
<p>One-sentence summary</p>
<p>A required file could not be read because it is corrupted or inconsistent.</p>
<p>What this code means</p>
<p>0x80070570 commonly indicates a corruption or integrity issue with a file or set of files needed for an operation. It can occur during installs, updates, file copies, or system repairs when Windows cannot validate or read the data correctly.</p>
<p>Where users usually see this code</p>
<p>Copy/move operations in File Explorer</p>
<p>Windows Update or feature install workflows</p>
<p>Repair/recovery tools and setup screens</p>
<p>Servicing and integrity check logs</p>
<p>Why this code usually appears</p>
<p>Corrupted download or installation media</p>
<p>Disk or filesystem errors causing bad reads/writes</p>
<p>Interrupted update/install leaving partial files</p>
<p>Security software quarantined or modified a required file</p>
<p>What typically happens next</p>
<p>The operation stops and reports failure</p>
<p>A retry may fail again until the underlying corruption is addressed</p>
<p>What this code is NOT</p>
<p>It is not always proof that the disk is failing</p>
<p>It does not identify which file is corrupted without logs</p>
<p>Troubleshooting checklist</p>
<p>Retry the operation after a restart</p>
<p>Ensure the source files/media are complete (re-download if applicable)</p>
<p>Check disk health and filesystem integrity using built-in Windows tools</p>
<p>Temporarily disable non-essential security software if it is interfering (re-enable after testing)</p>
<p>If this happens during an update, use official Windows repair/update guidance</p>
<p>Related error codes</p>
<p>0x80070002 — File not found</p>
<p>0x80070003 — Path not found</p>
<p>0x8007045d — I/O device error</p>
<p>0x80070643 — Installation failed</p>
<p>Notes and edge cases</p>
<p>Corruption symptoms can also be caused by incomplete downloads or abrupt power loss during writes.</p>

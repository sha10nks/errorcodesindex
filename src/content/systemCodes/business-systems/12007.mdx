<p>Title</p>
<p>(12007 &mdash; Internet connection error)</p>
<p>One-sentence summary</p>
<p>A business application could not connect to an online update or service endpoint.</p>
<p>What this code means</p>
<p>12007 is often displayed when a desktop business application cannot reach a required web service (for updates, payroll, licensing, or account connectivity). It usually points to connectivity, proxy, firewall, or TLS inspection issues.</p>
<p>Where users usually see this code</p>
<p>Payroll or tax table update checks</p>
<p>In-app update download steps</p>
<p>Account sign-in and validation flows</p>
<p>Why this code usually appears</p>
<p>Proxy settings are required but not configured</p>
<p>Firewall blocks outbound connections</p>
<p>DNS resolution problems</p>
<p>TLS/certificate interception or system time mismatch</p>
<p>What typically happens next</p>
<p>Updates fail and the application may run without new data</p>
<p>Retry may succeed after network changes</p>
<p>What this code is NOT</p>
<p>It is not a company file database error</p>
<p>It is not a payment authorization decline</p>
<p>Troubleshooting checklist</p>
<p>Confirm general internet access from the same workstation</p>
<p>Check proxy settings and corporate firewall policies</p>
<p>Verify system date/time for certificate validation</p>
<p>Test the update from another network to isolate network restrictions</p>
<p>Use the vendor’s support guidance for required endpoints/ports</p>

<p>15241 — Payroll/update error</p>
<p>PS038 — Payroll subscription state issue</p>
<p>Notes and edge cases</p>
<p>In managed networks, the fix is often a policy or proxy change rather than an application reinstall.</p>

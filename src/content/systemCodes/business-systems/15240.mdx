<p>(15240 &mdash; Update download/validation failed)</p>
<p>One-sentence summary</p>
<p>An application update could not be downloaded or validated, often due to connectivity or TLS settings.</p>
<p>What this code means</p>
<p>15240 is commonly shown by desktop business software during update checks when the program cannot complete the secure download or validation process. The underlying issue is frequently network/proxy configuration, blocked endpoints, or certificate validation failures.</p>
<p>Where users usually see this code</p>
<p>Payroll/tax table update flows</p>
<p>Program update utilities</p>
<p>Background update agents</p>
<p>Why this code usually appears</p>
<p>Proxy or firewall blocks the update service</p>
<p>System time/time zone causes TLS validation failures</p>
<p>Security inspection modifies certificates</p>
<p>Update endpoints are temporarily unavailable</p>
<p>What typically happens next</p>
<p>The update does not install and the application remains on the previous version</p>
<p>A retry may succeed after network changes or later</p>
<p>What this code is NOT</p>
<p>It is not a company file corruption code</p>
<p>It is not proof the vendor account is locked</p>
<p>Troubleshooting checklist</p>
<p>Retry later to rule out vendor-side outages</p>
<p>Verify system date/time and Windows updates</p>
<p>Confirm proxy/firewall rules allow the vendor’s update endpoints</p>
<p>Test using a different network to isolate local restrictions</p>
<p>Use official vendor update tools and avoid third-party download sources</p>

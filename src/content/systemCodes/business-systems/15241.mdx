<p>One-sentence summary</p>
<p>A payroll or program update step failed after download, validation, or patch application.</p>
<p>What this code means</p>
<p>15241 is reported by some business applications when an update process cannot complete. This may be due to permissions, a service/agent not running, patch prerequisites, or connectivity restrictions that prevent a required validation step.</p>
<p>Where users usually see this code</p>
<p>Payroll update workflows</p>
<p>Product patch utilities</p>
<p>After partial or interrupted updates</p>

<p>Required update services are stopped</p>
<p>Corrupted cache from an interrupted download</p>
<p>Security tools block executable patch steps</p>
<p>What typically happens next</p>
<p>The update does not apply and the program remains outdated</p>
<p>Retry may succeed after repair or elevated install</p>

<p>Restart the workstation and retry to clear stuck agents</p>
<p>Check security software logs/quarantine</p>

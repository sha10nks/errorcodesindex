<p>Title</p>
<p>(80029C4A &mdash; Error loading type library)</p>
<p>One-sentence summary</p>
<p>A Windows component or program dependency failed to load a required type library, often during application start.</p>
<p>What this code means</p>
<p>80029C4A is commonly surfaced by Windows applications when a required COM/ActiveX type library cannot be loaded. In business software, it frequently appears after an update, repair, or system change that leaves a dependency unregistered, missing, or mismatched.</p>
<p>Where users usually see this code</p>
<p>Application launch errors</p>
<p>Post-update startup failures</p>
<p>Business apps that rely on Windows components (COM/.NET/VC runtimes)</p>
<p>Why this code usually appears</p>
<p>A required component was removed or corrupted</p>
<p>Version mismatch after updates or partial installs</p>
<p>Registration for a dependency is broken</p>
<p>Security software blocked or quarantined a dependency</p>
<p>What typically happens next</p>
<p>The application fails to start or a module fails to load</p>
<p>Repair or reinstall is often required to restore dependencies</p>
<p>What this code is NOT</p>
<p>It is not a payment processing decline code</p>
<p>It is not a user credential/authentication error by itself</p>
<p>Troubleshooting checklist</p>
<p>Restart and retry to rule out transient locks</p>
<p>Run the application’s official repair tool (if available)</p>
<p>Ensure Windows updates and required runtimes are installed</p>
<p>Check security software logs/quarantine for blocked DLLs</p>
<p>If the issue started after an update, re-run the installer to restore missing components</p>
<p>Related error codes</p>

<p>1904 — Module registration failure</p>
<p>6000-83 — Company file open error (application-specific)</p>
<p>Notes and edge cases</p>
<p>This code can be emitted by many Windows programs; always correlate with the application name and the failing module.</p>

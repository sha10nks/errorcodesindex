<p>A company file open operation failed due to access or configuration conditions.</p>
<p>What this code means</p>

<p>It is not the same as a payment network response code</p>
<p>It is not guaranteed to be a data loss event</p>
<p>Troubleshooting checklist</p>
<p>Confirm the product version and the exact code/message shown</p>
<p>Check whether the issue occurs on one device or for all users</p>
<p>Verify file paths, permissions, and required services are running</p>
<p>Confirm network stability if multi-user or hosted</p>
<p>Retry after a controlled restart of the application and host services</p>

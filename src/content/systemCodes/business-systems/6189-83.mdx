<p>Title</p>
<p>(6189, 83 &mdash; Company file cannot be opened)</p>
<p>One-sentence summary</p>
<p>The application could not open the company file in a multi-user or hosted environment.</p>
<p>What this code means</p>
<p>6189, 83 commonly appears when a business application cannot open a hosted data file, often due to a service/hosting or permissions issue. It can also occur when lock files are not created/updated properly on the shared folder.</p>
<p>Where users usually see this code</p>
<p>Multi-user mode access to a shared company file</p>
<p>Workstations connecting to a server-hosted file</p>
<p>After moving/restoring a company file</p>
<p>Why this code usually appears</p>
<p>Permissions prevent the product from creating lock/temp files</p>
<p>Hosting/database services are stopped or misconfigured</p>
<p>Network connectivity is intermittent</p>
<p>Security tools block file/database communication</p>
<p>What typically happens next</p>
<p>The company file fails to open</p>
<p>Users may be blocked until hosting/service settings are corrected</p>
<p>What this code is NOT</p>
<p>It is not necessarily an indication the data is corrupted</p>
<p>It is not always caused by the end user’s PC</p>
<p>Troubleshooting checklist</p>
<p>Confirm read/write permissions for all users on the share</p>
<p>Check the host/server configuration and running services</p>
<p>Try opening the file locally to isolate network vs file issues</p>
<p>Ensure the host and workstation can communicate over required ports</p>
<p>Follow vendor guidance for multi-user hosting diagnostics</p>

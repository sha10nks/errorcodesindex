<p>Title</p>
<p>(H505 &mdash; Host configuration problem)</p>
<p>One-sentence summary</p>
<p>The client could not complete multi-user access because the host configuration was not acceptable.</p>
<p>What this code means</p>
<p>H505 is commonly associated with host-side configuration preventing a workstation from accessing a shared company file in multi-user mode. It typically points to hosting settings, network name resolution, or required services not being reachable as expected.</p>
<p>Where users usually see this code</p>
<p>Sign-in, licensing, or activation flows</p>
<p>Company file or dataset access steps</p>
<p>Multi-user or hosted setups</p>
<p>Sync or update operations</p>
<p>Why this code usually appears</p>
<p>A required service, permission, or configuration step failed</p>
<p>A file or database resource could not be opened reliably</p>
<p>Network name resolution or connectivity was interrupted</p>
<p>The product detected a validation or state mismatch</p>
<p>What typically happens next</p>
<p>The workflow stops and prompts for retry</p>
<p>A limited error message is shown to the user</p>
<p>Support logs may contain the full cause</p>
<p>What this code is NOT</p>
<p>It is not the same as a payment network response code</p>
<p>It is not guaranteed to be a data loss event</p>
<p>Troubleshooting checklist</p>
<p>Confirm the product version and the exact code/message shown</p>
<p>Check whether the issue occurs on one device or for all users</p>
<p>Verify file paths, permissions, and required services are running</p>
<p>Confirm network stability if multi-user or hosted</p>
<p>Retry after a controlled restart of the application and host services</p>
<p>If the issue persists, follow vendor support guidance with logs</p>

<p>Title</p>
<p>(49.4C02 &mdash; Firmware/data processing error)</p>
<p>One-sentence summary</p>
<p>A printer firmware error occurred while processing a job or incoming data.</p>
<p>What this code means</p>
<p>49.xx class errors on many enterprise printers are “service errors” that indicate the device firmware encountered a condition it could not recover from while processing a print job or data stream. 49.4C02 is often associated with job/data issues, firmware bugs, or memory/resource problems.</p>
<p>Where users usually see this code</p>
<p>Printer control panel showing a service error</p>
<p>Immediately after sending a specific document to print</p>
<p>After a firmware update or configuration change</p>
<p>Why this code usually appears</p>
<p>A malformed or complex print job triggers a firmware crash</p>
<p>Driver/print language mismatch (PCL/PS) produces unexpected data</p>
<p>Firmware needs updating or reinstalling</p>
<p>Memory/storage resources are constrained</p>
<p>What typically happens next</p>
<p>Printing stops and the device may reboot</p>
<p>The same job may repeatedly trigger the error until removed</p>
<p>What this code is NOT</p>
<p>It is not a simple paper jam code</p>
<p>It is not necessarily a defective printer</p>
<p>Troubleshooting checklist</p>
<p>Power-cycle the printer and clear the print queue</p>
<p>Reprint a different document to isolate whether the job is the trigger</p>
<p>Update printer firmware and driver from the manufacturer</p>
<p>Switch print driver language (PCL vs PostScript) for testing when supported</p>
<p>If the error repeats on all jobs, use official service diagnostics</p>
<p>Related error codes</p>
<p>49 Service Error — General firmware/service error</p>
<p>79 Service Error — Firmware/system error</p>
<p>50.6 — Fuser error</p>
<p>Notes and edge cases</p>
<p>These errors are model-specific; the same code can have slightly different meaning across firmware families.</p>

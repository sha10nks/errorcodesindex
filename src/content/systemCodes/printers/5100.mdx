<p>CODE: 5100</p>
<p>Title</p>
<p>(5100 &mdash; Carriage/encoder error)</p>
<p>One-sentence summary</p>
<p>A printer reported a carriage movement or position sensing problem and stopped printing.</p>
<p>What this code means</p>
<p>Error 5100 is widely associated with inkjet printers reporting a carriage motion issue. It can occur when the printhead carriage cannot move freely or when the printer’s position/encoder sensing is disrupted.</p>
<p>Where users usually see this code</p>
<p>Inkjet printer panel displaying a fault message</p>
<p>Immediately after a paper jam or obstruction</p>
<p>During startup self-checks</p>
<p>Why this code usually appears</p>
<p>Paper fragments or debris blocking the carriage path</p>
<p>Ink buildup or mechanical friction</p>
<p>Encoder strip contamination</p>
<p>What typically happens next</p>
<p>Printing stops until the obstruction or fault condition is cleared</p>
<p>What this code is NOT</p>
<p>It is not a Wi-Fi/connection issue</p>
<p>It is not a “low ink” indicator</p>
<p>Troubleshooting checklist</p>
<p>Turn off the printer and check for jammed paper and debris</p>
<p>Remove any partially fed sheets carefully</p>
<p>Follow manufacturer cleaning/maintenance steps for the carriage area</p>
<p>If the fault repeats, use official service guidance for your model</p>

<p>Notes and edge cases</p>
<p>Exact meaning varies by model family; use the printer’s service documentation for definitive mapping.</p>

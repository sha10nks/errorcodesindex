<p>Title</p>
<p>(50.4 &mdash; Fuser error)</p>
<p>One-sentence summary</p>
<p>A printer reported a fuser-related failure condition.</p>
<p>What this code means</p>
<p>50.4 is commonly associated with a fuser error condition on some laser printer families. It indicates a problem detected in the fuser subsystem, which can stop printing until resolved or serviced.</p>
<p>Where users usually see this code</p>
<p>Printer display panels or status lights</p>
<p>Driver and print queue dialogs</p>
<p>Maintenance and service screens</p>
<p>During firmware updates or job processing</p>
<p>Why this code usually appears</p>
<p>A mechanical or consumable condition prevented printing</p>
<p>Firmware/job processing hit an internal fault state</p>
<p>Communication between host and printer failed</p>
<p>A required component reported an out-of-range state</p>
<p>What typically happens next</p>
<p>Printing pauses or stops</p>
<p>The printer may request service or a reset</p>
<p>The error may persist until the underlying condition is cleared</p>
<p>What this code is NOT</p>
<p>It is not always a permanent hardware failure</p>
<p>It is not necessarily caused by the computer or driver</p>
<p>Troubleshooting checklist</p>
<p>Check whether the code appears on the printer itself or only on the computer</p>
<p>Power-cycle the printer after clearing obvious paper/consumable issues</p>
<p>Clear the print queue and retry a small test print</p>
<p>Confirm the printer firmware and driver are up to date</p>
<p>If the device reports a service error repeatedly, follow official support guidance</p>
<p>Avoid disassembly unless explicitly instructed by the manufacturer</p>

<p>Notes and edge cases</p>
<p>Many printer codes are model-family specific; confirm the exact model when comparing documentation.</p>

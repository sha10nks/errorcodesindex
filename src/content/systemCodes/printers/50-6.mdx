<p>Title</p>
<p>(50.6 &mdash; Fuser error)</p>
<p>One-sentence summary</p>
<p>The printer detected a fuser/heater problem and stopped to prevent damage.</p>
<p>What this code means</p>
<p>50.x codes on many laser printers relate to the fuser assembly (the heated rollers that bond toner to paper). A 50.6 style error typically indicates the fuser did not reach/maintain the expected temperature or the fuser circuit reported a fault.</p>
<p>Where users usually see this code</p>
<p>Printer control panel during warm-up or printing</p>
<p>Right after power-on or after a long idle period</p>
<p>Why this code usually appears</p>
<p>Fuser assembly failure or worn components</p>
<p>Power/voltage irregularities affecting heater control</p>
<p>Connector/contacts issues between fuser and printer</p>
<p>What typically happens next</p>
<p>Printing stops and the printer may require service</p>
<p>What this code is NOT</p>
<p>It is not an ink cartridge error</p>
<p>It is not a driver/software-only issue</p>
<p>Troubleshooting checklist</p>
<p>Power off and allow the printer to cool before handling</p>
<p>Reseat the fuser if the model supports user-replaceable fusers</p>
<p>Check for official maintenance kit replacement guidance</p>
<p>Use manufacturer service procedures for electrical parts; avoid unsafe DIY repairs</p>

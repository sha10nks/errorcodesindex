<p>Title</p>
<p>(55.1 &mdash; Internal controller error)</p>
<p>One-sentence summary</p>
<p>The printer detected an internal controller/memory condition it could not recover from.</p>
<p>What this code means</p>
<p>55.x errors on many enterprise printers are internal errors related to the controller, memory, or system state. 55.1 can be triggered by firmware conditions, memory issues, or configuration/state problems.</p>
<p>Where users usually see this code</p>
<p>Printer control panel at startup</p>
<p>After a firmware update or crash</p>
<p>During printing of complex jobs</p>
<p>Why this code usually appears</p>
<p>Firmware glitch or inconsistent system state</p>
<p>Memory/processing constraints</p>
<p>Hardware controller fault</p>
<p>What typically happens next</p>
<p>The printer stops printing and may reboot</p>
<p>Service intervention may be required if persistent</p>
<p>What this code is NOT</p>
<p>It is not a paper jam message</p>
<p>It is not a toner-low indicator</p>
<p>Troubleshooting checklist</p>
<p>Power-cycle and verify whether the error clears</p>
<p>Update firmware to the latest supported version</p>
<p>Remove add-on memory/expansion cards for isolation if supported</p>
<p>If the error persists at boot, consult manufacturer service documentation</p>
<p>Related error codes</p>
<p>49 Service Error — Firmware/service error</p>
<p>79 Service Error — Firmware/system error</p>
<p>Notes and edge cases</p>
<p>Some internal errors are intermittent; logging the exact sequence and recent changes helps support diagnose faster.</p>

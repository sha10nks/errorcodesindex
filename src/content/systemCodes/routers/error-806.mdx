<p>(Error 806 &mdash; VPN connection failed)</p>
<p>One-sentence summary</p>
<p>A VPN connection could not be established, often due to blocked ports or protocol restrictions.</p>
<p>What this code means</p>
<p>Error 806 is a VPN connectivity failure often associated with blocked traffic required for the VPN protocol. It commonly points to firewall, NAT, or ISP restrictions preventing the VPN tunnel from forming.</p>
<p>Where users usually see this code</p>
<p>PPTP/L2TP VPN connections from home or office networks</p>
<p>Networks with strict outbound firewall policies</p>
<p>Why this code usually appears</p>
<p>Firewall blocks required VPN ports/protocols</p>
<p>NAT device does not support required passthrough</p>
<p>VPN server is unreachable or misconfigured</p>
<p>What typically happens next</p>
<p>The VPN fails to connect</p>
<p>What this code is NOT</p>
<p>It is not a Wi-Fi SSID/password issue</p>
<p>It is not a guarantee that credentials are wrong</p>
<p>Troubleshooting checklist</p>
<p>Test VPN from a different network (mobile hotspot) to isolate local blocks</p>
<p>Confirm required VPN ports/protocols are allowed by the firewall/router</p>
<p>Check VPN server status with your admin/provider</p>
<p>Related error codes</p>
<p>Error 809 — VPN tunnel could not be established</p>
<p>Error 789 — L2TP connection failed</p>
<p>Notes and edge cases</p>

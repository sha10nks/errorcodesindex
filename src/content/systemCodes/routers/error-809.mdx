<p>CODE: Error 809</p>
<p>Title</p>
<p>(Error 809 &mdash; VPN tunnel could not be established)</p>
<p>One-sentence summary</p>
<p>A VPN tunnel could not be established, commonly due to blocked ports or NAT/firewall configuration.</p>
<p>What this code means</p>
<p>Error 809 is a common Windows VPN error that indicates the client could not establish the connection to the VPN server. A frequent cause is that required VPN ports or IPsec traffic are blocked by a firewall, router, or ISP.</p>
<p>Where users usually see this code</p>
<p>L2TP/IPsec or other Windows VPN connections</p>
<p>Networks with strict outbound firewall rules</p>
<p>Why this code usually appears</p>
<p>Firewall blocks IPsec/L2TP traffic</p>
<p>NAT device does not support required VPN passthrough/NAT-T</p>
<p>VPN server is unreachable</p>
<p>What typically happens next</p>
<p>VPN fails to connect until network policy/config is changed</p>
<p>What this code is NOT</p>
<p>It is not automatically a wrong password error</p>
<p>It is not a local Wi-Fi credential issue</p>
<p>Troubleshooting checklist</p>
<p>Test from a different network to confirm whether the local network is blocking VPN traffic</p>
<p>Confirm required ports/protocols with the VPN admin</p>
<p>Check router/firewall settings for VPN passthrough</p>
<p>Related error codes</p>
<p>Error 789 — L2TP connection failed</p>
<p>Error 806 — VPN connection failed</p>
<p>Error 807 — Network connection interrupted</p>
<p>Notes and edge cases</p>
<p>Many corporate VPNs require specific firewall allowances; coordinate with IT rather than guessing.</p>

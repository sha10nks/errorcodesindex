<p>CODE: Error 738</p>
<p>Title</p>
<p>(Error 738 &mdash; Server did not assign an address)</p>
<p>One-sentence summary</p>
<p>The remote server did not assign an IP address during the connection process.</p>
<p>What this code means</p>
<p>Error 738 generally indicates that the server did not provide an IP address, or the negotiation failed. In PPP-style connections, address assignment is part of establishing a usable session.</p>
<p>Where users usually see this code</p>
<p>PPPoE/broadband dial attempts</p>
<p>PPP-based VPN connections</p>
<p>Why this code usually appears</p>
<p>ISP provisioning issues</p>
<p>Server-side address pool problems</p>
<p>Incorrect PPP settings or negotiation failures</p>
<p>What typically happens next</p>
<p>The connection fails and the device remains offline</p>
<p>What this code is NOT</p>
<p>It is not a DNS error</p>
<p>It is not a local Wi-Fi password issue</p>
<p>Troubleshooting checklist</p>
<p>Restart modem/router and retry</p>
<p>Confirm PPPoE credentials/service status with the ISP</p>
<p>Check whether multiple sessions are blocked by the ISP account</p>
<p>Related error codes</p>
<p>Error 735 — Requested address rejected</p>
<p>Error 734 — PPP negotiation failed</p>
<p>Error 651 — Modem/router error</p>
<p>Notes and edge cases</p>
<p>If multiple customers report the same error, an ISP-side issue is likely.</p>

<p>Title</p>
<p>(Error 812 &mdash; Connection blocked by policy)</p>
<p>One-sentence summary</p>
<p>A VPN/remote connection was blocked because the access policy did not allow the requested connection parameters.</p>
<p>What this code means</p>
<p>Error 812 is commonly associated with VPN connections rejected due to server-side network policy settings. The VPN server may require specific authentication methods, user groups, device compliance, or encryption settings.</p>
<p>Where users usually see this code</p>
<p>Corporate VPN access attempts</p>
<p>After changes to account permissions or VPN policy</p>
<p>Why this code usually appears</p>
<p>User account is not permitted by VPN policy</p>
<p>Authentication type or encryption requirements do not match</p>
<p>Network policy server rules changed</p>
<p>What typically happens next</p>
<p>The VPN connection is rejected until policy or client settings are corrected</p>
<p>What this code is NOT</p>
<p>It is not a router Wi-Fi signal issue</p>
<p>It is not always caused by an incorrect password</p>
<p>Troubleshooting checklist</p>
<p>Confirm with your admin what VPN type and authentication method is required</p>
<p>Verify your account is authorized for VPN access</p>
<p>Check whether device compliance or MFA is required</p>
<p>Related error codes</p>
<p>Error 809 — VPN tunnel could not be established</p>
<p>Error 789 — L2TP connection failed</p>
<p>Notes and edge cases</p>
<p>This is typically resolved by policy changes on the VPN server rather than local router changes.</p>

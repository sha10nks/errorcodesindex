<p>CODE: Error 734</p>
<p>Title</p>
<p>(Error 734 &mdash; PPP link control protocol terminated)</p>
<p>One-sentence summary</p>
<p>A PPP/PPPoE session negotiation failed and the link control protocol was terminated.</p>
<p>What this code means</p>
<p>Error 734 is a PPP negotiation failure that can appear in broadband/PPPoE environments. It generally indicates that the PPP link could not be established because a required negotiation step failed or was rejected.</p>
<p>Where users usually see this code</p>
<p>PPPoE dial-up/broadband connection attempts</p>
<p>ISP connection setup screens</p>
<p>Router or modem PPP logs (sometimes mapped to PPP failure)</p>
<p>Why this code usually appears</p>
<p>Authentication or negotiation parameters rejected by the ISP</p>
<p>Incorrect PPP settings (protocol/options)</p>
<p>Line/ISP service issues preventing session establishment</p>
<p>What typically happens next</p>
<p>The connection fails and no internet session is established</p>
<p>Retries may continue to fail until configuration or ISP status is corrected</p>
<p>What this code is NOT</p>
<p>It is not a Wi-Fi password error</p>
<p>It is not a DNS resolution error by itself</p>
<p>Troubleshooting checklist</p>
<p>Confirm ISP PPPoE credentials and connection type</p>
<p>Reboot modem/router and retry to clear stale sessions</p>
<p>Verify PPPoE settings match ISP requirements</p>
<p>Check for ISP outages or account provisioning issues</p>
<p>Related error codes</p>
<p>Error 691 — Access denied</p>
<p>Error 651 — Modem/router error</p>
<p>Error 720 — PPP control protocols not configured</p>
<p>Notes and edge cases</p>
<p>Some routers surface PPP negotiation failures with different wording; PPP logs provide the most precise cause.</p>

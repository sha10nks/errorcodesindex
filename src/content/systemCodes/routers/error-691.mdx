<p>CODE: Error 691</p>
<p>Title</p>
<p>(Error 691 &mdash; Access denied)</p>
<p>One-sentence summary</p>
<p>Authentication failed for a PPP connection, often due to credentials or permission.</p>
<p>What this code means</p>
<p>Error 691 commonly indicates a PPP authentication failure. The credentials were not accepted or the connection attempt was not permitted under the current configuration or account state.</p>
<p>Where users usually see this code</p>
<p>WAN/PPP connection attempts</p>
<p>Device network status dialogs</p>
<p>ISP authentication and session setup</p>
<p>After modem/router restarts or configuration changes</p>
<p>Why this code usually appears</p>
<p>PPP authentication or negotiation failed</p>
<p>The WAN link could not be established</p>
<p>Name resolution or DHCP assignment failed</p>
<p>A modem/router configuration mismatch prevented connectivity</p>
<p>What typically happens next</p>
<p>Internet access is unavailable</p>
<p>Devices may connect locally but not reach the WAN</p>
<p>Retry may succeed after restoring the failing layer</p>
<p>What this code is NOT</p>
<p>It is not always a router hardware defect</p>
<p>It is not always caused by the ISP</p>
<p>Troubleshooting checklist</p>
<p>Confirm whether the issue affects one device or the whole network</p>
<p>Restart in order: modem (if present) → router → affected device</p>
<p>Check WAN status lights and the router status page if available</p>
<p>Verify credentials and connection type (e.g., PPPoE) if applicable</p>
<p>Test name resolution by trying a different DNS setting if appropriate</p>
<p>If the issue persists, contact ISP or router vendor with the full error</p>
<p>Related error codes</p>

<p>Error 678 — No response</p>
<p>Error 720 — PPP control failed</p>

<p>Notes and edge cases</p>
<p>Some “router” errors are shown by the device OS or connection stack, not the router UI itself.</p>

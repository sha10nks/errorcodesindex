<p>CODE: Error 789</p>
<p>Title</p>
<p>(Error 789 &mdash; L2TP connection failed)</p>
<p>One-sentence summary</p>
<p>An L2TP/IPsec VPN connection could not be established due to negotiation or authentication failure.</p>
<p>What this code means</p>
<p>Error 789 is commonly associated with L2TP/IPsec VPN failures where the security negotiation cannot complete. The failure can be caused by missing/incorrect certificates or pre-shared keys, blocked ports, or policy mismatches.</p>
<p>Where users usually see this code</p>
<p>Windows VPN connection attempts</p>
<p>Remote access VPN setups behind NAT/firewalls</p>
<p>Why this code usually appears</p>
<p>Incorrect VPN credentials or shared secret</p>
<p>Blocked IPsec/L2TP ports by firewall or ISP</p>
<p>Certificate or policy mismatch</p>
<p>What typically happens next</p>
<p>The VPN session fails and no tunnel is created</p>
<p>What this code is NOT</p>
<p>It is not a Wi-Fi-only issue</p>
<p>It is not a generic “DNS failed” error</p>
<p>Troubleshooting checklist</p>
<p>Confirm the VPN type and authentication method with your admin/provider</p>
<p>Verify required ports and IPsec policies are allowed on the network</p>
<p>Check whether the environment requires NAT-T and that it’s supported</p>
<p>Related error codes</p>
<p>Error 809 — VPN tunnel could not be established</p>
<p>Error 868 — Remote connection not made</p>
<p>Notes and edge cases</p>
<p>Corporate networks may block IPsec/L2TP; testing from a different network can help isolate policy blocks.</p>

<p>CODE: DOUBLE FREE</p>
<p>Title</p>
<p>(DOUBLE FREE &mdash; Memory freed twice)</p>
<p>One-sentence summary</p>
<p>The firmware attempted to free a heap pointer more than once, corrupting allocator state.</p>
<p>What this code means</p>
<p>“Double free” indicates a programming error where the same heap allocation is released twice. In embedded systems this can lead to heap corruption, random crashes, and unpredictable behavior.</p>
<p>Where users usually see this code</p>
<p>Debug builds with heap checks enabled</p>
<p>Crash logs that include allocator diagnostics</p>
<p>Why this code usually appears</p>
<p>Pointer ownership is unclear between modules</p>
<p>Error-handling paths free memory twice</p>
<p>Race conditions in multi-threaded code</p>
<p>What typically happens next</p>
<p>Heap corruption leading to crash/reset</p>
<p>What this code is NOT</p>
<p>It is not a normal field-service “hardware” error</p>
<p>It is not a connectivity failure</p>
<p>Troubleshooting checklist</p>
<p>Capture the call stack and allocation/free trace if available</p>
<p>Review code paths for ownership and lifetime rules</p>
<p>Related error codes</p>
<p>HEAP CORRUPTION — Allocator state corruption</p>
<p>MALLOC FAILED — Heap allocation failed</p>
<p>Notes and edge cases</p>
<p>In production firmware, these issues often present as random reboots without clear “double free” text.</p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_HUNG occurs when the graphics subsystem detects that the GPU did not respond within the expected time frame. The system terminates the operation to prevent instability. This is a runtime detection event, not a hardware failure determination. It does not automatically mean the graphics card is defective. The error reflects a timeout or stalled rendering process.</span></p>

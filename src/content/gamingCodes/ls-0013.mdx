<p class="c1"><span class="c0">LS-0013 appears when the launcher is unable to start a game process. The failure occurs at the launch validation or initialization stage. It does not indicate account enforcement or licensing removal. The launcher blocks execution when required conditions are not met. The issue reflects a platform-side launch failure.</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">WS-37397-9 appears when PSN restricts account access due to a detected policy or account-related issue. The suspension is applied at the account level, not the console or network. This status prevents access to certain online services. It does not automatically imply permanent enforcement. The code reflects a platform decision rather than a local system error.</span></p>

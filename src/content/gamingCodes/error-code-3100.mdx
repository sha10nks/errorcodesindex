<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Error Code 3100 appears when an automated integrity system flags activity that prevents a session from starting or continuing. The trigger occurs during pre-session checks or live monitoring. It does not automatically confirm intentional misconduct. The system enforces a block to preserve fair play conditions. The event reflects an integrity control response rather than a technical crash.</span></p>

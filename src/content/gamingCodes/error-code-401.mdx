<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Error Code 401 appears when a service rejects a request due to missing or invalid authorization. The system understands the request but does not permit it without proper authentication or permission. This is a service-level access control response. It does not indicate a server failure. Authorization status must be valid for the request to proceed.</span></p>

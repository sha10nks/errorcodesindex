<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this code means</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Error Code 3200 appears when a service limits connection throughput or request frequency. Throttling is applied to manage load and protect infrastructure. It does not indicate account enforcement. Requests may be delayed or rejected. Access may normalize once limits are relaxed.</span></p>
